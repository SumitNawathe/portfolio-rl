The Company is focused on providing innovative products and solutions to consumer, SMB, education, enterprise, government
and creative customers that greatly enhance their evolving digital lifestyles. The Company is the only participant in the personal computer and consumer electronics industries that controls the design and development of the entire personal computer,
including the hardware, operating system, and sophisticated software applications, as well as the design and development of portable digital music players, mobile communication devices, and a variety of products and solutions for obtaining and
enjoying digital content. The Company is therefore uniquely positioned to offer superior and well-integrated digital lifestyle products and solutions, which are further enhanced by the Companys emphasis on ease-of-use and creative industrial
designs. 

 

The Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including personal computers with its Mac line of personal computers, consumer
electronics with its iPod product families, mobile communications with iPhone, and distribution of third-party digital content through its online iTunes Store. While the Company is widely recognized as a leading innovator in the personal computer
and consumer electronics markets as well as a leader in the emerging market for distribution of digital content, these markets are highly competitive and subject to aggressive pricing. To remain competitive, the Company believes that increased
investment in research and development and marketing and advertising is necessary to maintain or expand its position in the markets where it competes. The Companys R&D spending is focused on further developing its existing Mac line of
personal computers, its operating system, application software, iPhone and iPods; developing new digital lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas and technologies. The Company also believes
increased investment in marketing and advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand awareness. 

 

The Company utilizes a variety of direct
and indirect distribution channels. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration, demonstrate
the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available only on Mac computers, and demonstrate the compatibility of the Mac with the Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support
experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to expand and improve its distribution
capabilities by opening its own retail stores in the U.S. and internationally. The Company had 247 stores open as of September 27, 2008. 

 

The Company
has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales, including the Apple Sales Consultant Program, which places Apple employees and contractors at selected third-party reseller locations. The Company believes providing direct contact with its
targeted customers is an efficient way to demonstrate the advantages of its Mac computers and other products over those of its competitors. The Company also sells to customers directly through its online stores around the world and through its
direct sales force. 

 

The Companys iPods are sold through a significant number of distribution points to provide broad access. iPods can be purchased
in certain department stores, member-only warehouse stores, large retail chains, and specialty retail stores, as well as through the channels for Mac distribution listed above. 

 

iPhone is distributed through the Company, its cellular network carriers distribution channels, and certain third-party resellers. The Company has signed multi-year agreements with various cellular network
carriers authorizing them to distribute and provide cellular network services for iPhone 3G in over 70 countries. These agreements are generally not exclusive with a specific carrier, except in the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Spain, Ireland, and
certain other countries. The Company expects to ship iPhone 3G in over 70 countries by the end of calendar year 2008. 

 

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates 

 

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the
Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Companys management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts

reported in its Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and
such differences may be material. 

 

Management believes the Companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue
recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because
they are both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Companys senior management has
reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. 

 

Revenue Recognition 

 

Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, music products, digital content,
peripherals, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue for software products (operating system software and applications software), or any product that is considered to be software-related, in accordance with the guidance in
Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 03-5, 

Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to Non-software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software

, (e.g., Mac computers, iPod portable
digital music players and iPhone) pursuant to American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, 

Software Revenue Recognition

, as amended. For products that are not
software or software-related, (e.g., digital content sold on the iTunes Store and certain Mac, iPod and iPhone supplies and accessories), the Company recognizes revenue pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff
Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, 

Revenue Recognition. 

 

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the
Companys product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer
receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable,
revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. 

 

For both
Apple TV and iPhone, the Company has indicated that from time-to-time it may provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers. Therefore, sales of Apple TV and iPhone handsets are recognized under
subscription accounting in accordance with SOP No. 97-2. The Company recognizes the associated revenue and cost of goods sold on a straight-line basis over the currently estimated 24-month economic lives of these products, with any loss
recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred by the Company for engineering, sales, marketing, and warranty are expensed as incurred. 

 

The Company records
reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. For transactions involving price
protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Companys policy
requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later
of the date at

which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future
product returns based on the Companys historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result
in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience
and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have a negative
impact on the Companys results of operations. 

 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 

 

The Company distributes its products through third-party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and enterprise customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its
customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin
America, Europe, Asia, and Australia and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Companys direct customers. These credit-financing arrangements are directly
between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit-risk-sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by
collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel partners. 

 

The
allowance for doubtful accounts is based on managements assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. The Company records
an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that it reasonably believes to be collectible. The Company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors, including historical experience with bad
debts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the Companys distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customers financial condition, if the Company becomes aware
of additional information related to the credit-worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful
accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made. 

 

Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments 

 

The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and
products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple
factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communications industries are subject to a rapid and
unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Companys products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the
utility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs, which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write-downs were recorded. 

 

The Company accrues reserves for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components
through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Companys requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and
substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Companys products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Companys products, the Company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation
fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded.

Warranty Costs 

 

The
Company provides for the estimated cost for hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific
product failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products
subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. For products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to SOP No. 97-2, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. If actual product failure rates or
repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the Companys results of operations. 

 

The Company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system software to maintain the softwares compliance with specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for
as warranty cost that is recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur,
and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates. 

 

Stock-Based Compensation 

 

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004),


Share-Based Payment

. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the awards fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option-pricing
model and is recognized as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The BSM option-pricing model requires various judgmental assumptions including expected volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected option life.
Significant changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the fair value of stock-based awards granted in the future. 

 

 

Income
Taxes 

 

The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with SFAS
No. 109, 

Accounting for Income Taxes

, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable
income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. Effective at
the beginning of 2008, the Company adopted Financial Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, 

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

. Further information may be found in Note 5,
Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. 

 

Management believes it is more likely than not that
forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the
event that the Company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made.
In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of FIN 48 and other complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with
managements expectations could have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results. 

 

Legal and Other
Contingencies 

 

As discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading Legal Proceedings and in Note 8 Commitments and
Contingencies in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is subject to 




 

 




40 










Table of Contents







various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, 

Accounting for Contingencies

,
the Company records a contingent liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be
reasonably estimated. In managements opinion, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial
condition or operating results. However, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company are subject to significant uncertainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these
legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 

 

Net Sales 

 

Fiscal years 2008 and 2007 spanned 52 weeks while fiscal year 2006 spanned 53 weeks. An additional week is
included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters.

Fiscal Year 2008 versus 2007 

 

Net sales during 2008 increased 35% or $8.5 billion from 2007. Several factors contributed to these increases including the following: 

 

 










 









 




 

Mac net sales increased $4.0 billion or 38% during 2008 compared to 2007, while Mac unit sales increased by 2.7 million units or 38%. Net sales related to the
Companys Mac shipments accounted for 44% of the Companys total net revenue. Higher Mac unit sales, which contributed to the increases in net sales, were driven by higher sales of all of the Companys portable products as well as the
popularity of the iMac, which experienced strong growth in net sales and unit sales in all of the Companys reportable segments. Unit sales of the Companys portable products accounted for 62% of the Companys personal computer
shipments in both 2008 and 2007. Net sales and unit sales of the Companys portable products both increased by 38% during 2008 compared to 2007. This growth was attributable to strong demand for all the portable products, particularly the
MacBook, which had double-digit growth in all of the Companys operating segments, and the addition of the MacBook Air, which was introduced to the Companys portable product line in January 2008. Growth of the Companys desktop
systems was also strong, with increased net sales and unit sales of 39% and 37%, respectively, during 2008 due primarily to strong sales of the iMac in all of the Companys operating segments. 

 

 










 









 




 

Net sales of iPods increased $848 million or 10% during 2008 compared to 2007 whereas unit sales of iPods increased 6% compared to 2007. The iPod unit growth was
due to strong demand for the iPod touch, and to a lesser extent, higher unit sales of the iPod shuffle due to a price reduction in February 2008. iPod net sales grew faster than iPod unit sales due to higher average selling prices caused by a shift
in overall iPod product mix to the higher priced iPod touch. 

 

 










 









 




 

Net sales of iPhone and related products and services were $1.8 billion for 2008, with iPhone handset unit sales totaling 11.6 million. During 2008, sales of iPhone
expanded beyond the U.S. and the Company expects to be shipping iPhones in over 70 countries by the end of December 2008. Net sales of iPhone and related products and services were $123 million in 2007, which represented sales for one fiscal
quarter. iPhone net sales include the portion of handset revenue recognized in accordance with subscription accounting over the products 24-month estimated economic life, as well as revenue from sales of iPhone accessories and from carrier
agreements. 

 

 










 









 




 

Net sales of other music related products and services increased $844 million or 34% during the 2008 compared to 2007, due primarily to significantly increased net
sales from the iTunes Store in each of the Companys geographic segments. The Company believes this success is the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading third-party digital content, the expansion of third-party audio and video
content available for sale and rent via the iTunes Store, and the launch of the iTunes App Store. The Company continues to expand its iTunes content offerings around the world.

Net sales of software, service, and other sales rose $699 million or 46% during 2008 compared to 2007. This growth was due in large part to increased sales of
Apple-branded and third-party developers software products and increased net sales of AppleCare Protection Plan (APP) extended service and support contracts. 

 

Fiscal Year 2007 versus 2006 

 

Net sales during 2007 increased
24% or $4.7 billion from 2006 even though fiscal year 2007 spanned 52 weeks while fiscal year 2006 spanned 53 weeks. Several factors contributed to these increases including the following: 

 

 










 









 




 

Mac net sales increased $3 billion or 40% during 2007 compared to 2006, while Mac unit sales increased by 1.75 million units or 33%. The 33% Mac unit sales
growth rate is significantly greater than the estimated growth rate of the overall personal computer industry during that timeframe. Unit sales of the Companys portable products accounted for 62% of the Companys personal computer
shipments in 2007, up from 54% in 2006. Net sales and unit sales of the Companys portable products increased 55% and 51%, respectively, during 2007 compared to 2006. This growth was due to strong demand for the MacBook, which increased in each
of the Companys operating segments, as well as the MacBook Pro, which increased in each operating segment except Japan. Mac desktop net sales and unit sales increased by 21% and 12%, respectively, during 2007 due to stronger sales of the iMac
in each of the Companys operating segments. The Mac desktop net sales growth was greater than the unit sales growth due primarily to a shift in desktop product mix away from the lower-price Mac Mini and discontinued eMac and toward the iMac.


 

 










 









 




 

Net sales of iPods increased $629 million or 8% during 2007 compared to 2006. Unit sales of iPods increased 31% compared to 2006. The iPod growth was driven
primarily by increased sales of the iPod shuffle and iPod nano particularly in international markets. iPod unit sales growth was significantly greater than iPod net sales due to a shift in overall iPod product mix, as well as due to lower selling
prices for the iPod classic, iPod nano and iPod shuffle in 2007 compared to 2006. 

 

 










 









 




 

Net sales of iPhone and related products and services were $123 million in 2007. iPhone net sales include the portion of iPhone handset revenue recognized in
accordance with subscription accounting over the products 24-month estimated economic life, as well as sales of iPhone accessory products and revenue from carrier agreements. iPhone unit sales were 1.39 million in 2007.


 

 










 









 




 

Net sales of other music related products and services increased $611 million or 32% during 2007 compared to 2006 due to increased net sales from the iTunes Store.
The Company believes this growth was the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital content and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the iTunes Store. 

 

 










 









 




 

Net sales of peripherals and other hardware increased $160 million or 15% compared to 2006 due to an increase in wireless networking products and other hardware
accessories, including printers and scanners, which was partially offset by a decrease in net sales of displays. 

 

 










 









 




 

Net sales of software, service, and other sales rose $229 million or 18% during 2007 compared to 2006. This growth was attributable primarily to increased net sales
of APP extended service and support contracts and increased sales of Apple branded and third-party developers software products.

Table of Contents




Americas 

 

During
2008, net sales in the Americas segment increased $3.0 billion or 26% compared to 2007. The primary drivers of this growth were the significant year-over-year increase in sales of the iPod touch, Mac portable systems, content from the iTunes Store,
and iPhone. The Company began shipping iPhone in June 2007 and the growth in iPhone sales in 2008 resulted from a full year of iPhone shipments. The increase in Mac net sales of $1.3 billion or 30% and Mac unit sales of 961 million or 32% is
attributable to growth in all of the Mac portable systems, particularly the MacBook, and higher sales of the iMac. Net sales of iPods increased due to a shift in product mix toward higher priced iPods, particularly the iPod touch, which was upgraded
in June 2008. In 2008, the Americas segment represented 45% of the Companys total net sales as compared to 48% in the same period of 2007. During 2008, U.S. education channel net sales and Mac unit sales increased by 14% and 19%, respectively,
compared to 2007. Net sales from the higher education market grew 15% during 2008 compared to 2007, while net sales in the K-12 market grew 12% during the same period. 

 

During 2007, net sales in the Americas segment increased $2.2 billion, or 23%, compared to 2006. The main sources of this growth were Mac portable products, iMacs, iPods, and the sales of third-party content from the
iTunes Store. Sales of Mac portable products increased due to the popularity of the MacBook, introduced in May 2006 and updated in May 2007, as well as the MacBook Pro, introduced in January 2006 and updated in June 2007. Sales of iMacs grew due to
a shift in desktop product mix away from the Mac mini and discontinued eMac as well as the strong reception of the new iMac introduced in August 2007. Sales of iPods grew due to increased demand for the iPod nano and iPod shuffle and the
introduction of the iPod touch in September 2007. During 2007, the Americas segment represented 48% of the Companys total net sales as compared to 49% in the same period of 2006. During 2007, U.S. education channel net sales and Mac unit sales
increased by 14% and 18%, respectively, compared to 2006. Net sales from the higher education market grew 17% during 2007 compared to 2006, while net sales in the K-12 market grew 10% during the same period. 

 

Europe 

 

For 2008, net sales and unit sales in Europe increased 40%
and 39%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2007. The main drivers of this growth were strong sales of Mac portable systems and iMac, increased sales from the iTunes Store, and iPhone. Also contributing to the increase in net sales were
higher iPod net sales due primarily to the iPod touch, which was upgraded in June 2008. Sales of Mac portable products increased due to the MacBook Pro and the MacBook, both updated in February 2008, as well as the MacBook Air, introduced in January
2008. Mac desktop sales also increased due primarily to the popularity of the iMac, which was updated in April 2008. Sales from the iTunes Store grew substantially by 79% from 2007 as a result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital
content and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the iTunes Store. The Europe segment represented 23% of total net sales in 2008, consistent with 2007. 

 

Europe segment net sales increased $1.4 billion or 33% during 2007 compared to 2006. Consistent with the Americas segment, the primary drivers of this growth were Mac
portable products, iMacs, iPods, and the sales of third-party content from the iTunes Store. Sales of Mac portable products increased due to the popularity of both the MacBook and MacBook Pro. Sales of iMacs grew due to a shift in desktop product
mix away from the Mac mini and discontinued eMac as well as the strong reception of the new iMac introduced in August 2007. Sales of iPods grew due primarily to increased demand for the iPod nano and iPod shuffle. The Company believes that the
growth in iTunes Store sales was the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital content and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the iTunes Store. 

 

Japan 

 

Japan net sales increased $427 million or 39% in 2008 compared
to 2007. The primary contributors to the growth in net sales were increases in sales of iPods, iMac, Mac portable systems, and strong sales from the iTunes Store. Net sales, unit sales and the average selling price of iPods increased during 2008
compared to 2007, driven by strong demand for iPod touch and iPod nano. Additionally, Mac net sales and unit sales grew 42% and 29%, respectively, in 2008 compared to 2007 due to increase in sales of the iMac and Mac portable systems, particularly
MacBook, as well as the introduction of MacBook Air in January 2008.

Table of Contents




Japans net sales declined by $129 million or 11% in 2007 compared to 2006. Total Mac unit sales in Japan declined
1% during 2007. The decrease in the Japan segments overall net sales was attributable primarily to decreases in iPod and Mac desktop sales, partially offset by an increase in revenue from MacBooks and sales of third-party content from the
iTunes Store. The decline in net sales and Mac unit sales is partially attributable to Japans declining consumer PC market, and the iPod sales decline is due primarily to lower average selling prices. The Company is continuing to evaluate ways
to improve the future results of its Japan segment. 

 

Retail 

 

Retail net sales grew by 53% during 2008 compared to 2007, due in large part to increased sales of Mac portable and desktop products, strong demand for the iPhone and iPod touch, and new store openings. The Company opened 50 new retail
stores during 2008, including a total of 19 international stores, bringing the total number of open stores to 247 as of September 27, 2008. This compares to 197 open stores as of September 29, 2007 and 165 open stores as of
September 30, 2006. With an average of 211 stores and 178 stores opened during 2008 and 2007, respectively, average revenue per store increased to $29.9 million for 2008, compared to $23.1 million in 2007. 

 

Retail Mac net sales and Mac unit sales grew by 42% and 47%, respectively, during 2008 compared to the 2007, due primarily to strong demand for MacBook, iMac, and MacBook
Air, introduced in January 2008. Net sales of iPods increased due to the popularity of the iPod touch, which was upgraded in June 2008, and a higher average selling price compared to 2007. The higher iPod average selling price was due to strong
demand for the iPod touch. 

 

The Retail segments net sales increased by 27% to $4.1 billion during 2007 compared to 2006. Retail segment Mac unit sales
increased 56% during 2007 as compared to 2006. With an average of 178 stores open during 2007, average revenue per store was $23.1 million, compared to $22.9 million in 2006. The increase in Retail segment net sales during 2007 compared to 2006 was
due primarily to stronger sales of Mac portable products, iMacs, accessories and services. The increase was partially offset primarily by lower net sales of iPods and other music related products due to the expanded availability of those products
through third-party resellers. 

 

As measured by the Companys operating segment reporting, the Retail segment reported operating income of $1.3 billion
during 2008 as compared to operating income of $875 million and $600 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. This improvement in 2008 was attributable primarily to the significant Retail net sales growth of 53% as compared to 2007. 




Expansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease
commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital asset purchases associated with the Retail segment were $389 million in 2008, bringing the total capital asset purchases since inception of the Retail segment to $1.4 billion. As of
September 27, 2008, the Retail segment had approximately 15,900 full-time equivalent employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of $1.4 billion. The Company would incur
substantial costs if it were to close multiple retail stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results. 

 

Other Segments 

 

The Companys Other Segments, which consist of its Asia Pacific and FileMaker operations, experienced an increase in
net sales of $707 million, or 40% during 2008 as compared to 2007. These increases are related primarily to strong growth in sales of all Mac portable systems, iPods, the iMac, and content from the iTunes Store in the Companys Asia Pacific
region. Sales from the iTunes Store in the Companys Asia Pacific region grew significantly by 109% over 2007. Mac net sales and unit sales grew by 52% and 50%, respectively, due to increased sales of the iMac and all Mac portables. 




The Companys Other Segments experienced an increase in net sales of $406 million, or 30% during 2007 compared to 2006. This increase related primarily to a 58%
increase in sales of Mac portable products and strong iPod sales in the Companys Asia Pacific region.

Gross margin percentage was relatively flat in 2008 as compared to 2007. Gross margin percentage of 34.0% in 2007
increased significantly from 29.0% in 2006. The primary drivers of this increase were more favorable costs on certain commodity components, including NAND flash memory and DRAM memory, higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed
production costs and a higher percentage of revenue from the Companys direct sales channels. 

 

The Company expects its gross margin percentage to
decrease in future periods compared to levels achieved during 2008 and 2007, and anticipates gross margin levels of about 30% in 2009. This expected decline is due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions, flat or reduced pricing on
new and innovative products that have higher cost structures, both expected and potential future cost increases for key components, a stronger U.S. dollar, and higher logistical costs. 

 

The foregoing statements regarding the Companys expected gross margin percentage are forward-looking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors, including but not limited to certain of
those set forth below in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors under the subheading 

Future operating results depend upon the Companys ability to obtain key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash
memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities

, which is incorporated herein by reference. There can be no assurance that targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved. In general, gross margins and
margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions and
expected increases in the cost of key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and liquid crystal displays (LCDs), as well as potential increases in the
costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Companys sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to these competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing
actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Companys ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the
Companys significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.

Research and Development (R&D) 

 

Expenditures for R&D increased 42% or $327 million to $1.1 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. These increases were due primarily to an increase in R&D headcount in
the current year to support expanded R&D activities and higher stock-based compensation expenses. In 2008, $11 million of software development costs were capitalized

Table of Contents







related to Mac OS X Version 10.6 Snow Leopard and excluded from R&D expense, while R&D expense for 2007 excluded $75 million of capitalized software
development costs related to Mac OS X Leopard and iPhone. Although total R&D expense increased 42% during 2008, it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 35% increase in revenue during 2008. The Company continues to
believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Companys core
business strategy. As such, the Company expects to increase spending in R&D to remain competitive. 

 

Expenditures for R&D increased 10% or $70
million to $782 million in 2007 compared to 2006. The increases in R&D expense were due primarily to an increase in R&D headcount in 2007 to support expanded R&D activities, partially offset by one less week of expenses in the first
quarter of 2007 and the capitalized software development costs mentioned above. 

 

Selling, General, and Administrative Expense (SG&A)


 

Expenditures for SG&A increased $798 million or 27% to $3.8 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. These increases are due primarily to higher
stock-based compensation expenses, higher variable selling expenses resulting from the significant year-over-year increase in total net sales and the Companys continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international
markets. In addition, the Company incurred higher spending on marketing and advertising during 2008 compared to 2007. 

 

Expenditures for SG&A increased
$530 million or 22% during 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was due primarily to higher direct and indirect channel variable selling expenses resulting from the significant year-over-year increase in total net sales in 2007, the Companys
continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international markets, and higher spending on marketing and advertising, partially offset by one less week of expenses in the first quarter of 2007.

Total other income and expense increased $21 million to $620 million during 2008 as compared to $599 million
and $365 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. While the Companys cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances increased by 59% in 2008, other income and expense increased only 4% due to the decline in the weighted average
interest rate earned of 3.44%. The overall increase in other income and expense is attributable to the Companys higher cash and short-term investment balances, which more than offset the decline in interest rates during 2008 as compared to
2007. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments was 5.27% and 4.58% during 2007 and 2006, respectively. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company had no debt outstanding and
accordingly did not incur any related interest expense. 

 

Provision for Income Taxes 

 

The Companys effective tax rates were 30% for the years ended September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, and 29% for the year ended September 30, 2006. The Companys effective rates differ
from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. 

 

As of September 27, 2008, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $2.1 billion before being
offset against certain deferred liabilities for presentation on the Companys balance sheet. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including 




 

 




47 










Table of Contents







income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be
sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. The Company released a valuation allowance of $5 million since it has been determined that it is more likely than not the associated deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company
will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. 

 

The Internal
Revenue Service (the IRS) has completed its field audit of the Companys federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company has contested certain of these adjustments through the
IRS Appeals Office. All IRS audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any
adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements
expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. 

 

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements 

 

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157, 

Fair Value Measurements,


which defines fair value, provides a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to other accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements; it does not
require any new fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 157-1, 

Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That
Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13 

and FSP No. FAS 157-2

, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157

. FSP 157-1 amends SFAS No. 157 to remove certain leasing
transactions from its scope. FSP 157-2 delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized
or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 157-3, 

Determining the
Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active

, to clarify the application of SFAS 157 in inactive markets for financial assets. FSP 157-3 became effective upon issuance and SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2007 and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No. 157, management does not currently believe
adoption will have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or operating results. 

 

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,


The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilitiesincluding an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115.

 SFAS No. 159 allows companies to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at
fair value that are not required to be measured at fair value. SFAS No. 159 requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings at each reporting date. SFAS No. 159 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No. 159, management does
not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or operating results. 

 

In December 2007, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), 

Business Combinations

, which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed,
and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree in a business combination. SFAS No. 141R also establishes principles around how goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase should be recognized and measured, as
well as provides guidelines on the disclosure requirements on the nature and financial impact of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and will be adopted by the
Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No. 141R, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Companys financial
condition or operating results.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, 

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activitiesan amendment of FASB Statement No. 133,

 which requires companies to provide additional disclosures about its objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments, how the derivative instruments and related hedged items
are accounted for under SFAS No. 133, 

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, and related interpretations, and how the derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the Companys financial statements.
SFAS No. 161 also requires companies to disclose information about credit risk-related contingent features in their hedged positions. SFAS No. 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008 and
is required to be adopted by the Company beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No. 161, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact
on the Companys financial condition or operating results.

As of September 27, 2008, the Company had $24.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments,
an increase of $9.1 billion from September 29, 2007. The principal components of this net increase were cash generated by operating activities of $9.6 billion, proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock plans of $483 million and
excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $757 million. These increases were partially offset by payments for acquisitions of property, plant, and equipment of $1.1 billion, payments made in connection with business acquisitions, net of
cash acquired, of $220 million and payments for acquisitions of intangible assets of $108 million. The Companys cash generated by operating activities significantly exceeded its net income due primarily to the large increase in deferred
revenue, net of deferred costs, associated with subscription accounting for iPhone. 

 

The Companys short-term investment portfolio is invested
primarily in highly rated securities with a minimum rating of single-A. As of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, $11.3 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively, of the Companys cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments
were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. The Company had $117 million in net unrealized losses on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities ranging from
one to five years, as of September 27, 2008, and net unrealized losses of approximately $11 million on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities from one to five years, as of September 29, 2007. The
Company has the intent and ability to hold such investments for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested. Accordingly, none of these declines in fair value were recognized in the Companys
Statement of Operations.

 

The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its
working capital needs, capital expenditures, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. 

 

Capital Assets 

 

The Companys cash payments for capital asset purchases were $1.1 billion during 2008,
consisting of $389 million for retail store facilities and $702 million for real estate acquisitions and corporate infrastructure including information systems enhancements. The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $1.5 billion for capital
asset purchases during 2009, including approximately $400 million for Retail facilities and approximately $1.1 billion for corporate facilities and infrastructure.

Lease Commitments 

 

As of September 27, 2008, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of $1.8 billion, $1.4 billion of which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities. The Companys major
facility leases are generally for terms of 3 to 20 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 1 to 5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain
multi-year renewal options. 

 

Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers 

 

The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Companys products and to perform final assembly and test of finished
products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its
products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such
purchase commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. In addition, the Company has an off-balance sheet warranty obligation for products accounted for
under subscription accounting pursuant to SOP No. 97-2 whereby the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. As of September 27, 2008, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments, component
purchase commitments, and estimated warranty commitments of $5.4 billion. 

 

During 2006, the Company entered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix
Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash memory through calendar year 2010. As part of these agreements, the Company prepaid $1.25 billion
for flash memory components during 2006, which will be applied to certain inventory purchases made over the life of each respective agreement. The Company utilized $567 million of the prepayment as of September 27, 2008. 

 

Asset Retirement Obligations 

 

The Companys asset retirement
obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. As of September 27, 2008, the Company estimated that gross expected future cash flows of $28 million would
be required to fulfill these obligations.

Other Obligations 

 

Other outstanding obligations were $471 million as of September 27, 2008, which related to advertising, research and development, Internet and telecommunications services, and other obligations. 

 

During the first quarter of 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48. The Company had historically classified interest and penalties and unrecognized tax
benefits as current liabilities, but beginning with the adoption of FIN 48 the Company has reclassified gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as
non-current liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 27, 2008, the Company recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $506 million and gross interest and penalties of $219 million, both of which are classified as
non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes; therefore,
such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. 

 

Indemnifications 

 

The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party
intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an
indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a
liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of
either September 27, 2008 or September 29, 2007.

Overview and Highlights Company Background The Company designs, manufactures and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and portable digital music players, and sells a
variety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions and third-party digital content and applications. The Companys products and services include iPhone®, iPad®, Mac®, iPod®, Apple
Watch®, Apple TV®, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, iOS, OS X®, watchOS and tvOSoperating systems, iCloud®, Apple Pay® and a variety
of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company sells and delivers digital content and applications through the iTunes Store®, App
Store®, Mac App Store, TV App Store, iBooks Store and Apple Music (collectively Internet Services). The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores,
online stores and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Apple compatible products, including
application software and various accessories through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. Business Strategy The Company is committed to bringing the
best user experience to its customers through its innovative hardware, software and services. The Companys business strategy leverages its unique ability to design and develop its own operating systems, hardware, application software and
services to provide its customers products and solutions with innovative design, superior ease-of-use and seamless integration. As part of its strategy, the Company continues to expand its platform for the discovery and delivery of digital content
and applications through its Internet Services, which allows customers to discover and download digital content, iOS, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV applications, and books through either a Mac or Windows-based computer or through iPhone, iPad and
iPod touch® devices (iOS devices) and Apple Watch. The Company also supports a community for the development of third-party software and hardware products and digital content that
complement the Companys offerings. The Company believes a high-quality buying experience with knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the Companys products and services greatly enhances its ability to attract and retain
customers. Therefore, the Companys strategy also includes building and expanding its own retail and online stores and its third-party distribution network to effectively reach more customers and provide them with a high-quality sales and
post-sales support experience. The Company believes ongoing investment in research and development (R&D), marketing and advertising is critical to the development and sale of innovative products and technologies. Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal
holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Product introductions can also impact the Companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these
channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and often, channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and
distributors anticipate a product introduction. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Companys future pattern of product introductions,
future net sales or financial performance. First Quarter Fiscal 2016 Highlights Net sales grew 2% or $1.3 billion during the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, primarily driven by strong growth in Other
Products and in Services, partially offset by lower iPad net sales. Additionally, the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted the Companys net sales. Other Products and Services net sales
increased in all of the Companys reportable operating segments. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company released OS X El Capitan, its 12th major release of OS X, and its new tvOS operating system. Additionally, the Company began shipping iPad Pro and the new Apple TV, and launched its Apple TV App Store. Sales Data The following table shows net sales by operating
segment and net sales and unit sales by product during the three months ended December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 (dollars in millions and units in thousands):",-0.8819056473562975

The Company is focused on providing innovative products and solutions to consumer, SMB,
education, enterprise, government and creative customers that greatly enhance their evolving digital lifestyles and work environments. The Companys overall business strategy is to control the design and development of the hardware and software
for all of its products, including the personal computer, mobile communications and consumer electronics devices. The Companys business strategy leverages its unique ability to design and develop its own operating system, hardware, application
software, and services to provide its customers new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative industrial design. The Company believes continual investment in research and development is critical to the
development and enhancement of innovative products and technologies. In conjunction with its strategy, the Company continues to build and host a robust platform for the discovery and delivery of third-party digital content and applications through
the iTunes Store. Most recently the Company launched the App Store that allows users to browse, search for, and purchase third-party applications through either a Mac or Windows-based computer or by wirelessly downloading directly to an iPhone or
iPod touch. The Company also desires to support a community for the development of third-party products that complement the Companys offerings through its developer programs. The Company is therefore uniquely positioned to offer superior and
well-integrated digital lifestyle and productivity solutions. 

 

The Company participates in several highly competitive markets,
including personal computers with its Mac line of personal computers, mobile communications with iPhone, consumer electronics with its iPod product families, and distribution of third-party digital content and applications through its online iTunes
Store. While the Company is widely recognized as a leading innovator in the personal computer, mobile communications and consumer electronics markets as well as a leader in the emerging market for distribution of digital content and applications,
these markets are highly competitive and subject to aggressive pricing. To remain competitive, the Company believes that increased investment in research and development and marketing and advertising is necessary to maintain or expand its position
in the markets where it competes. The Companys research and development spending is focused on further developing its existing Mac line of personal computers, its operating system, application software, iPhone and iPods; developing new digital
lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas and technologies. The Company also believes increased investment in marketing and advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand
awareness. 

 

The Company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels. The Company believes that sales of
its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration, demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available on Mac
computers, and demonstrate the compatibility of the Mac with the Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing
customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by opening its own retail stores in the U.S. and in
international markets. The Company had 273 stores open as of September 26, 2009. 

 

The Company has also invested in
programs to enhance reseller sales, including the Apple Sales Consultant Program, which places Apple employees and contractors at selected third-party reseller locations, and the Apple Premium Reseller Program, through which independently run
businesses focus on the Apple platform and provide a high level of customer service and product expertise. The Company believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an efficient way to demonstrate the advantages of its Mac
computers and other products over those of its competitors. The Company also sells to customers directly through its online stores around the world and through its direct sales force. 

 

The Company distributes iPhone in over 80 countries, through its direct channels, its cellular network carriers distribution channels and certain third-party resellers. The
Company has signed multi-year agreements with various cellular network carriers authorizing them to distribute and provide cellular network services for iPhones. These agreements are generally not exclusive with a specific carrier, except in the
U.S., Germany, Spain, Ireland and certain other countries.

The Companys iPods are sold through a significant number of distribution points to
provide broad access. iPods can be purchased in certain department stores, member-only warehouse stores, large retail chains and specialty retail stores, as well as through the channels for Mac distribution listed above. 

 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

 

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and the Companys discussion and analysis of its
financial condition and operating results require the Companys management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements.
Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. 

 

Management believes the
Companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation of marketable securities, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, income
taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments
and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Companys senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. 




Revenue Recognition 

 

Net
sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, third-party digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue for software products (operating system software and
applications software), or any product that is considered to be software-related, in accordance with industry specific accounting guidance for software and software related transactions (e.g., Mac computers, iPhones and iPod portable digital music
and video players). For products that are not software or software-related, (e.g., third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store and certain Mac, iPhone and iPod supplies and accessories), the Company recognizes revenue pursuant to various
revenue-related GAAP as described below. 

 

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Companys
product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers recognition of revenue until the customer
receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable,
revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. 

 

For both iPhone and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time-to-time provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers. Accordingly, iPhone
handsets and Apple TV sales are accounted for under subscription accounting in accordance with GAAP. As such, the revenue and associated cost of sales are deferred at the time of sale, and are both recognized on a straight-line basis over the
currently estimated 24-month economic lives of these products, with any loss recognized at the time of sale. If the Companys estimated economic life of a product accounted for under subscription accounting changes, the


 

 




37 










Table of Contents





future rate at which deferred revenue and deferred costs are recognized in the Companys results of operations will change. Costs incurred by the Company for engineering, sales, marketing
and warranty are expensed as incurred. 

 

The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price
protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to
be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Companys policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not
recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at
which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase
customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to
estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Managements estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of
customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have a negative impact on the Companys results of operations. 

 

Valuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities 

 

The Companys investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of investments are included in accumulated
other comprehensive income, net of tax, as reported in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of investments impact the Companys net income only when such investments are sold or an other-than-temporary
impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each securitys cost basis. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any investment is
other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, the Company
evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Companys intent to sell, or whether it is more likely
than not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investments amortized cost basis. The Companys assessment on whether an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired or not, could change in the future due to
new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular investment. 

 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 

 

The Company distributes its products through third-party distributors, cellular network carriers, and resellers and directly to certain
education, consumer, and enterprise customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible the Company does
attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing
arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit-risk-sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade
receivables that are not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Companys distribution and retail channel partners.

Table of Contents




The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on managements assessment of the ability
to collect specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit-worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that it reasonably
believes to be collectible. The Company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors, including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the
Companys distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customers financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit-worthiness of a major
customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect its results of operations in the period the
adjustments are made. 

 

Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments 

 

The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products,
including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors
including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The personal computer, mobile communications and consumer electronics industries are subject to a rapid and
unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Companys products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the
utility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs, which would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the write-downs were recorded. 

 

The Company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be
cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Companys
requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Companys products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Companys
products, the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded. 

 

Warranty Costs 

 

The Company
provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product
failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to
warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. For products accounted for under subscription accounting, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates,
revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect the Companys results of operations. 

 

The Company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system software to maintain the softwares compliance with specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty cost that is
recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and
estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates.

Income Taxes 

 

The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with GAAP, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and
liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and
tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company
records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. 

 

The Company recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions in accordance with GAAP, whereby the Company only recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on
examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood
of being realized upon ultimate settlement. 

 

Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including
income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company
determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the
calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations
could have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results. 

 

Legal and Other Contingencies


 

As discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading Legal Proceedings and in Note 8,
Commitments and Contingencies in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with GAAP, the Company records a
liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In
managements opinion, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results.
However, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company are subject to significant uncertainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against
the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 

 

Net Sales 

 

Fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 spanned 52 weeks. An additional week is included in the first
fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters.

Fiscal Year 2009 versus 2008 

 

Net sales during 2009 increased $4.1 billion or 12% compared to 2008. Several factors contributed positively to these increases, including
the following: 

 

 










 









 




 

iPhone revenue and net sales of related products and services amounted to $6.8 billion in 2009, an increase of $4.9 billion or 266% compared to
2008. iPhone handset unit sales totaled 20.7 million during 2009, which represents an increase of 9.1 million or 78% during 2009 compared to 2008. This growth is attributed primarily to expanded distribution and strong overall demand for
iPhones. iPhone 3GS was released in the U.S. on June 19, 2009 and in many other countries over the remainder of 2009. iPhone revenue includes the portion of handset revenue recognized in the relevant period in accordance with subscription
accounting over the products currently estimated 24-month economic life, as well as revenue from sales of iPhone accessories and carrier agreements. The year-over-year iPhone revenue growth is also largely attributable to the year-over-year
increase in iPhone handset unit sales in both 2009 and 2008, which generated significant amounts of deferred revenue that is being recognized over the iPhones estimated economic life. 

 

 










 









 




 

Net sales of other music-related products and services increased $696 million or 21% during 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was due
predominantly to increased net sales of third-party digital content and applications from the iTunes Store, which experienced double-digit growth in each of the Companys geographic segments during 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. The
Company believes this continued growth is the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading third-party digital content and applications, continued growth in its customer base of iPod and iPhone customers, the expansion of third-party audio
and video content available for sale and rent via the iTunes Store, and the continued interest in and growth of the App Store. The Company continues to expand its iTunes content and applications offerings around the world.


 

Partially offsetting the favorable factors discussed above, net sales during 2009 were negatively impacted
by certain factors, including the following: 

 

 










 









 




 

Mac net sales declined 3% during 2009 compared to 2008, although Mac unit sales increased by 7% over the same period. Net sales per Mac unit sold
decreased by 10% during 2009 compared to 2008, due primarily to lower average selling prices across all Mac portable and desktop systems and a stronger U.S. dollar. Net sales of Macs accounted for 38% of the Companys total net sales for 2009.
During 2009, Mac portable systems net sales and unit sales increased by 9% and 20%, respectively, compared to 2008. This growth was driven by strong demand for MacBook Pro, which was updated in June 2009 and October 2008, and experienced double
digit net sales and unit growth in each of the Companys reportable operating segments compared to the same period in 2008. The Company also had a higher product mix of portable systems, which is consistent with the overall market trends.
However, net sales and unit sales of the Companys Mac desktop systems decreased by 23% and 14%, respectively, during 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease in net sales of Mac desktop systems was due mainly to a shift in product mix towards
lower-priced desktops, lower average selling prices across all Mac desktop systems and a stronger U.S. dollar. 

 

 










 









 




 

Net sales of iPods decreased $1.1 billion or 12% during 2009 compared to 2008. iPod unit sales decreased slightly by 1% during 2009 compared to
2008. Net sales per iPod unit sold decreased 11% to $149 in 2009 compared to 2008, resulting from lower average selling prices across all of the iPod product lines, which were due primarily to price reductions taken with the introduction of new
iPods in

September 2009 and September 2008 and a stronger U.S. dollar, offset partially by a higher product mix of iPod touch. 

 

Fiscal Year 2008 versus 2007 

 

Net sales during 2008 increased 35% or $8.5 billion from 2007. Several factors contributed to these increases including the following: 

 

 










 









 




 

Mac net sales increased $4.0 billion or 38% during 2008 compared to 2007, while Mac unit sales increased by 2.7 million units or 38%. Net sales
related to the Companys Mac shipments accounted for 44% of the Companys total net revenue. Higher Mac unit sales, which contributed to the increases in net sales, were driven by higher sales of all of the Companys Mac portable
products as well as the popularity of the iMac, which experienced strong growth in net sales and unit sales in all of the Companys reportable segments. Unit sales of the Companys Mac portable products accounted for 62% of the
Companys personal computer shipments in both 2008 and 2007. Net sales and unit sales of the Companys Mac portable products both increased by 38% during 2008 compared to 2007. This growth was attributable to strong demand for all the Mac
portable products, particularly the MacBook, which had double-digit growth in all of the Companys operating segments, and the addition of the MacBook Air, which was introduced to the Companys Mac portable product line in January 2008.
Growth of the Companys Mac desktop systems was also strong, with increased net sales and unit sales of 39% and 37%, respectively, during 2008 due primarily to strong sales of the iMac in all of the Companys operating segments.


 

 










 









 




 

Net sales of iPods increased $848 million or 10% during 2008 compared to 2007 whereas unit sales of iPods increased 6% compared to 2007. The iPod
unit growth was due to strong demand for the iPod touch, and to a lesser extent, higher unit sales of the iPod shuffle due to a price reduction in February 2008. iPod net sales grew faster than iPod unit sales due to higher average selling prices
caused by a shift in overall iPod product mix to the higher priced iPod touch. 

 

 










 









 




 

Net sales of iPhone and related products and services were $1.8 billion for 2008, with iPhone handset unit sales totaling 11.6 million. Net sales of
iPhone and related products and services were $123 million in 2007, which represented sales for one fiscal quarter. iPhone revenue includes the portion of handset revenue recognized in the relevant period in accordance with subscription accounting
over the products currently estimated 24-month economic life, as well as revenue from sales of iPhone accessories and from carrier agreements. 

 

 










 









 




 

Net sales of other music related products and services increased $844 million or 34% during 2008 compared to 2007, due primarily to significantly
increased net sales from the iTunes Store in each of the Companys geographic segments. The Company believes this success is the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading third-party digital content, the expansion of third-party
audio and video content available for sale and rent via the iTunes Store, and the launch of the iTunes App Store. The Company continues to expand its iTunes content offerings around the world. 

 

Segment Operating Performance 

 

The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Companys reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Japan and Retail. The Americas, Europe and Japan reportable segments do not include
activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the
U.S. and in international markets. Each reportable geographic operating segment and the Retail operating segment provide similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Companys operating segments

Table of Contents




Americas 

 

During 2009, net sales in the Americas segment increased $1.6 billion or 11% compared to 2008. The increase in net sales during 2009 was attributable to the significant year-over-year increase in iPhone
revenue, higher sales of third-party digital content and applications from the iTunes Store, and increased sales of Mac portable systems, which were partially offset by a decrease in sales of Mac desktop systems and iPods. Americas Mac net sales
decreased 6% due primarily to lower average selling prices, while Mac unit sales increased by 4% on a year-over-year basis. The increase in Mac unit sales was due primarily to strong demand for the MacBook Pro, which was updated in June 2009 and
October 2008. The Americas segment represented approximately 44% and 45% of the Companys total net sales in 2009 and 2008, respectively. 

 

During 2008, net sales in the Americas segment increased $3.0 billion or 26% compared to 2007. The primary drivers of this growth were the significant year-over-year increase in sales of the iPod touch,
Mac portable systems, content from the iTunes Store, and iPhone. The Company began shipping iPhone in June 2007 and the growth in iPhone sales in 2008 resulted from a full year of iPhone shipments as well as stronger demand for iPhones in the fourth
quarter of 2008. The increase in Mac net sales of $1.3 billion or 30% and Mac unit sales of 961 million or 32% is attributable to growth in sales of all of the Mac portable systems, particularly the MacBook, and higher sales of the iMac. Net
sales of iPods increased due to a shift in product mix toward higher priced iPods, particularly the iPod touch, which was upgraded in June 2008. In 2008, the Americas segment represented 45% of the Companys total net sales as compared to 48%
in the same period of 2007. 

 

Europe 

 

During 2009, net sales in Europe increased $1.7 billion or 23% compared to 2008. The increase in net sales was due mainly to increased iPhone revenue and Mac portable systems, offset partially by lower
net sales of Mac desktop systems, iPods, and a stronger U.S. dollar. Mac unit sales increased 13% in 2009 compared to 2008, which was driven primarily by increased sales of Mac portable systems, particularly MacBook Pro, while total Mac net sales
declined as a result of lower average selling prices across all Mac products. Although iPod net sales decreased in Europe year-over-year as a result of lower average selling prices, iPod unit sales increased due to iPod touch and market share
increases. The Europe segment represented 26% and 23% of total net sales in 2009 and 2008, respectively. 

 

Europes net
sales and Mac unit sales increased 40% and 39%, respectively, during 2008 compared to 2007. The main drivers of this growth were strong sales of Mac portable systems and iMac, increased sales from the iTunes Store, and iPhone. Also contributing to
the increase in net sales were higher iPod net sales due primarily to the iPod touch, which was upgraded in June 2008. Sales of Mac portable products increased due to stronger demand for the MacBook Pro and the MacBook, both updated in February
2008, as well as sales of the MacBook Air, introduced in January 2008. Mac desktop sales also increased due primarily to the popularity of the iMac, which was updated in April 2008. The Europe segment represented 23% of total net sales in 2008,
consistent with 2007. 

 

Japan 

 

Japans net sales increased $322 million or 21% in 2009 compared to 2008. The key contributors to this growth were increased iPhone revenue, stronger demand for certain Mac portable systems and
iPods, and strength in the Japanese Yen, partially offset by decreased sales of Mac desktop systems. Net sales and unit sales of Mac portable systems increased during 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by stronger demand for MacBook Pro, which
was updated in June 2009 and October 2008. Net sales and unit sales of iPods increased during 2009 compared to 2008, driven by strong demand for iPod touch and iPod nano. 

 

Japan net sales increased $427 million or 39% in 2008 compared to 2007. The primary contributors to the growth in net sales were increases in sales of iPods, iMac, Mac portable systems, and strong sales
from the iTunes Store. Net sales, unit sales and the average selling price of iPods increased during 2008 compared to 2007, driven by


 

 




44 










Table of Contents





strong demand for iPod touch and iPod nano. Additionally, Mac net sales and unit sales grew 42% and 29%, respectively, in 2008 compared to 2007 due to increases in sales of iMac and Mac portable
systems, particularly MacBook, as well as the introduction of MacBook Air in January 2008. 

 

Retail 

 

Retail net sales increased $259 million or 4% during 2009 compared to 2008. The growth in net sales was driven largely by increased iPhone
revenue and Mac portable systems, offset partially by a decrease in sales of iPods and Mac desktop systems. The Company opened 26 new retail stores during 2009, including a total of 14 international stores, ending the year with 273 stores open. This
compares to 247 stores open as of September 27, 2008 and 197 open stores as of September 29, 2007. 

 

The
year-over-year growth rate of Retail net sales was less than the increase in the average number of stores open during the same period, which the Company believes reflects the challenging consumer-spending environment and continued third-party
channel expansion, particularly in the U.S. where most of its stores are located. With an average of 254 stores and 211 stores opened during 2009 and 2008, respectively, average revenue per store decreased to $25.9 million for 2009 from $29.9
million in 2008. 

 

The Retail segments net sales grew by 53% during 2008 compared to 2007, due in large part to increased
sales of Mac portable and desktop systems, strong demand for the iPhone and iPod touch, and new store openings. The Company opened 50 new retail stores during 2008, bringing the total number of open stores to 247 as of September 27, 2008. This
compares to 197 open stores as of September 29, 2007. With an average of 211 stores and 178 stores opened during 2008 and 2007, respectively, average revenue per store increased to $29.9 million for 2008 from $23.1 million in 2007. 




As measured by the Companys operating segment reporting, the Retail segment reported operating income of $1.4 billion during 2009,
as compared to operating income of $1.3 billion and $875 million during 2008 and 2007, respectively. This increase in operating income in 2009 was driven by increased total Retail net sales attributable to a 20% increase in average stores open and
higher gross margin percentage consistent with that experienced Company-wide. The Retail segments operating income increased by $462 million during 2008 as compared to 2007 due primarily to the significant Retail net sales growth of 53% as
compared to 2007. 

 

Expansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed
assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital asset purchases associated with the Retail segment were $369 million in 2009, bringing the total capital asset purchases since inception
of the Retail segment to $1.8 billion. As of September 26, 2009, the Retail segment had approximately 16,500 full-time equivalent employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related
facilities of $1.5 billion. The Company would incur substantial costs if it were to close multiple retail stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results. 

 

Other Segments 

 

The
Companys Other Segments, which consist of its Asia Pacific and FileMaker operations, experienced an increase in net sales of $165 million, or 7%, during 2009 as compared to 2008 reflecting strong growth in sales of iPhone and Mac portable
systems offset partially by a decline in sales related to iPods and Mac desktop systems in the Asia Pacific region, as well as a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar and other Asian currencies. Mac net sales and unit sales
grew in the Asia Pacific region by 4% and 17%, respectively, due to increased sales of the MacBook Pro. 

 

The Companys
Other Segments experienced an increase in net sales of $707 million, or 40% during 2008 as compared to 2007. These increases are related primarily to strong growth in sales of all Mac portable systems,

iPods, the iMac, and content from the iTunes Store in the Companys Asia Pacific region. Sales from the iTunes Store in the Companys Asia Pacific region grew 109% compared to 2007.

34.0%




 

The gross margin percentage in 2009 was 36.0% compared to 34.3% in 2008. The primary
drivers of the increase in 2009 as compared to 2008 were significantly lower commodity and other product costs and a favorable sales mix toward products with higher gross margins, which were partially offset by product price reductions. Gross margin
percentage was relatively flat in 2008 as compared to 2007. 

 

The Company expects its gross margin percentage to decrease in
future periods compared to levels achieved during 2009 and anticipates gross margin levels of about 34% in the first quarter of 2010. This expected decline is due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions, flat or reduced pricing on
new and innovative products that have higher cost structures, and both expected and potential future cost increases for key components. 

 

The foregoing statements regarding the Companys expected gross margin percentage are forward-looking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors, including but not limited to
certain of those set forth below in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors under the subheading 

Future operating results depend upon the Companys ability to obtain key components including but not limited to microprocessors,
NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities

, which is incorporated herein by reference. There can be no assurance that targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved. In general, gross
margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product
transitions and expected increases in the cost of key components including but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and liquid crystal displays (LCDs), as well as potential
increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Companys sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to these competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take
product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Companys ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due
to the Companys significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.

Research and Development (R&D) 

 

R&D expenditures increased 20% or $224 million to $1.3 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. These increases were due primarily to an
increase in headcount and higher stock-based compensation expenses in the current year to support expanded R&D activities. In addition, $71 million of software development costs were capitalized related to Mac OS X Snow Leopard and excluded from
R&D expense during 2009, compared to $11 million of software development costs capitalized during 2008. Although total R&D expense increased 20% during 2009, it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 12% increase in
revenue in 2009. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are
central to the Companys core business strategy. As such, the Company expects to make further investments in R&D to remain competitive. 

 

Expenditures for R&D increased 42% or $327 million to $1.1 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. These increases were due primarily to an increase in headcount in 2008 and higher stock-based compensation
expenses. In 2008, $11 million of software development costs were capitalized related to Mac OS X Snow Leopard and excluded from R&D expense, while R&D expense for 2007 excluded $75 million of capitalized software development costs related
to Mac OS X Leopard and iPhone software. Although total R&D expense increased 42% during 2008, it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 35% increase in revenue during 2008. 

 

Selling, General and Administrative Expense (SG&A) 

 

SG&A expenditures increased $388 million or 10% to $4.1 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. These increases are due primarily to the Companys continued expansion of its Retail segment in both
domestic and international markets, higher stock-based compensation expenses and higher spending on marketing and advertising. 

 

Expenditures for SG&A increased $798 million or 27% to $3.8 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. These increases are due primarily to higher stock-based compensation expenses, higher variable selling expenses resulting from the significant
year-over-year increase in total net sales and the Companys continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international markets. In addition, the Company incurred higher spending on marketing and advertising during 2008
compared to 2007.

Total other income and expense decreased $294 million or 47% to $326 million during
2009 compared to $620 million and $599 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The overall decrease in other income and expense is attributable to the significant decline in interest rates during 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007, partially offset by
the Companys higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.43%, 3.44% and 5.27% during 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense. 

 

The Companys investment portfolio had gross unrealized losses of $16 million and $121 million as of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, respectively, which were offset by gross
unrealized gains of $73 million and $4 million as of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, respectively. The net unrealized gains


 

 




47 










Table of Contents





as of September 26, 2009 and the net unrealized losses as of September 27, 2008 related primarily to long-term marketable securities. The Company considers the declines in market value
of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature. The unrealized losses on the Companys marketable securities were caused primarily by changes in market interest rates, specifically widening credit spreads. The
Company does not have the intent to sell, nor is it more likely than not the Company will be required to sell, any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Accordingly, no material declines in fair value were recognized in the
Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations during 2009, 2008 and 2007. The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for
duration management. The Company recognized no material net gains or losses during 2009, 2008 and 2007 related to such sales. 

 

Provision
for Income Taxes 

 

The Companys effective tax rates were 29%, 30% and 30% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
Companys effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be
indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. 

 

As of September 26, 2009, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from
deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $3.2 billion before being offset against certain deferred liabilities of $1.8 billion for presentation on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. Management believes it is more
likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred
tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. 

 

The Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) has completed its field audit of the Companys federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. The
Company has contested certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. All IRS audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax
authorities. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the
Companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. 

 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

 

In September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) amended the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) as summarized in Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009-14, 

Software (Topic 985):
Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements

, and ASU 2009-13, 

Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements

. As summarized in ASU 2009-14, ASC Topic 985 has been amended to remove from the
scope of industry specific revenue accounting guidance for software and software related transactions, tangible products containing software components and non-software components that function together to deliver the products essential
functionality. As summarized in ASU 2009-13, ASC Topic 605 has been amended (1) to provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated, and the consideration allocated;
(2) to require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) or third-party evidence of selling price; and
(3) to eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method. The accounting changes summarized in ASU 2009-14 and ASU 2009-13 are both effective for fiscal years beginning on
or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. Adoption may either be on a prospective basis or by retrospective application.

Table of Contents




The Company is currently assessing the impact of these amendments to the ASC on its
accounting and reporting systems and processes; however, at this time the Company is unable to quantify the impact on its financial statements of its adoption or determine the timing and method of its adoption. As of September 26, 2009, total
iPhone and Apple TV deferred revenue and deferred costs were $12.1 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively. The Company believes that application of these amendments will result in a substantial portion of the revenue associated with the sale of
iPhone and Apple TV and all related cost of sales being recognized at the time of sale. Currently revenue and associated cost of sales for these products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the
currently estimated 24-month economic life of the products. 

 

During the first quarter of 2009, the Company adopted FASB ASC
820, 

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

 (formerly referenced as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, 

Fair Value Measurements

)

,

 which defines fair value, provides a framework for
measuring fair value, and expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued supplemental guidance that delays the effective date of this new fair value accounting standard to fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2008 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) and will be adopted by the
Company beginning in the first quarter of 2010. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of this accounting standard, management does not currently believe adoption of this accounting pronouncement will have a material impact
on the Companys financial condition or operating results. 

 

In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB ASC 805, 

Business
Combinations

 (formerly referenced as SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), 

Business Combinations

), which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets
acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree in a business combination. This new accounting standard also establishes principles regarding how goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain
purchase should be recognized and measured, as well as provides guidelines on the disclosure requirements on the nature and financial impact of the business combination. In April 2009, the FASB amended this new accounting standard to require that
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value, if the fair value can be determined during the measurement period. This new business combination accounting standard is
effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2010 and will apply prospectively to any business combinations completed on or after that date. The effect
of adoption of this new accounting pronouncement on the Companys financial condition or operating results will depend on the nature of acquisitions completed after the date of adoption.

As of September 26, 2009, the Company had $34.0 billion in cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $9.5 billion from September 27, 2008. The principal component of this net increase was the cash generated by operating activities of $10.2 billion, which was partially offset by payments for
acquisitions of property, plant and equipment of $1.1 billion. The Companys cash generated by operating activities significantly exceeded its net income due primarily to the increase in deferred revenue, net of deferred costs, associated with
subscription accounting for iPhone.

The Companys marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in
highly rated securities, generally with a minimum rating of single-A or equivalent. As of September 26, 2009 and September 27, 2008, $17.4 billion and $11.3 billion, respectively, of the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working
capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. 

 

Capital Assets 

 

The Companys cash payments for capital asset
purchases were $1.1 billion during 2009, consisting of $369 million for retail store facilities and $775 million for real estate acquisitions and corporate infrastructure including information systems enhancements. The Company anticipates utilizing
approximately $1.9 billion for capital asset purchases during 2010, including approximately $400 million for Retail facilities and approximately $1.5 billion for corporate facilities, infrastructure, and product tooling and manufacturing process
equipment. 

 

Historically the Company has opened between 25 and 50 new retail stores per year. During 2010, the Company expects
to open a number of new stores near the upper end of this range, over half of which are expected to be located outside of the U.S. 

 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 

 

The Company has not entered into any transactions
with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any
other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company. 

 

The following table presents certain payments due by the Company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of September 26, 2009 and excludes amounts already recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as current liabilities (in millions):

Lease Commitments 

 

As of September 26, 2009, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of $1.9 billion, $1.5 billion of which related to the lease of retail
space and related facilities. The Companys major facility leases are generally for terms of one to 20 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of one to five additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of five to 20
years, the majority of which are for ten years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. 

 

Purchase Commitments with Contract
Manufacturers and Component Suppliers 

 

The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies
for the Companys products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire components

Table of Contents





and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products
from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase
commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. In addition, the Company has an off-balance sheet warranty obligation for products accounted for under
subscription accounting whereby the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. As of September 26, 2009, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments, component purchase commitments and estimated
warranty commitments of $4.8 billion. 

 

The Company has entered into prepaid long-term supply agreements to secure the supply
of certain inventory components. During the first quarter of 2009, a long-term supply agreement with Intel Corporation was terminated and the remaining prepaid balance of $167 million was repaid to the Company. During the second and fourth quarters
of 2009, the Company made a prepayment of $500 million to LG Display for the purchase of LCD panels and a prepayment of $500 million to Toshiba to purchase NAND flash memory, respectively. As of September 26, 2009, the Company had a total
of $1.2 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding. 

 

Asset Retirement Obligations 

 

The Companys asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original
condition upon lease termination. As of September 26, 2009, the Company estimated that gross expected future cash flows of $32 million would be required to fulfill these obligations. 

 

Other Obligations 

 

Other
outstanding obligations were $356 million as of September 26, 2009, which related to advertising, research and development, Internet and telecommunications services and other obligations. 

 

As of September 26, 2009, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $971 million and an additional $291 million for gross interest and penalties classified as
non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by between $105 million and $145 million in the next 12 months. At
this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual
obligation table. 

 

Indemnifications 

 

The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other
agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However,
the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability related to unresolved
infringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September 26, 2009 or
September 27, 2008. 

 

The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers.
Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such

individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due
to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and
payments made under these agreements historically have not materially adversely affected the Companys financial condition or operating results.

Overview and Highlights Company Background The Company designs, manufactures and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and portable digital music players, and sells a
variety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions and third-party digital content and applications. The Companys products and services include iPhone®, iPad®, Mac®, iPod®, Apple
Watch®, Apple TV®, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, iOS, OS X®, watchOS and tvOSoperating systems, iCloud®, Apple Pay® and a variety
of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company sells and delivers digital content and applications through the iTunes Store®, App
Store®, Mac App Store, TV App Store, iBooks Store and Apple Music (collectively Internet Services). The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores,
online stores and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Apple compatible products, including
application software and various accessories through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. Business Strategy The Company is committed to bringing the
best user experience to its customers through its innovative hardware, software and services. The Companys business strategy leverages its unique ability to design and develop its own operating systems, hardware, application software and
services to provide its customers products and solutions with innovative design, superior ease-of-use and seamless integration. As part of its strategy, the Company continues to expand its platform for the discovery and delivery of digital content
and applications through its Internet Services, which allows customers to discover and download digital content, iOS, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV applications, and books through either a Mac or Windows-based computer or through iPhone, iPad and
iPod touch® devices (iOS devices) and Apple Watch. The Company also supports a community for the development of third-party software and hardware products and digital content that
complement the Companys offerings. The Company believes a high-quality buying experience with knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the Companys products and services greatly enhances its ability to attract and retain
customers. Therefore, the Companys strategy also includes building and expanding its own retail and online stores and its third-party distribution network to effectively reach more customers and provide them with a high-quality sales and
post-sales support experience. The Company believes ongoing investment in research and development (R&D), marketing and advertising is critical to the development and sale of innovative products and technologies. Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal
holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Product introductions can also impact the Companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these
channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and often, channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and
distributors anticipate a product introduction. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Companys future pattern of product introductions,
future net sales or financial performance. First Quarter Fiscal 2016 Highlights Net sales grew 2% or $1.3 billion during the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, primarily driven by strong growth in Other
Products and in Services, partially offset by lower iPad net sales. Additionally, the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted the Companys net sales. Other Products and Services net sales
increased in all of the Companys reportable operating segments. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company released OS X El Capitan, its 12th major release of OS X, and its new tvOS operating system. Additionally, the Company began shipping iPad Pro and the new Apple TV, and launched its Apple TV App Store. Sales Data The following table shows net sales by operating
