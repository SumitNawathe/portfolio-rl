ITEM 1. BUSINESS

                        GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS

    Abbott  Laboratories is an  Illinois corporation, incorporated  in 1900. The
Company's* principal business  is the discovery,  development, manufacture,  and
sale of a broad and diversified line of health care products and services.

              FINANCIAL INFORMATION RELATING TO INDUSTRY SEGMENTS,
               GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, AND CLASSES OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS

    Incorporated  herein by reference is the footnote entitled "Industry Segment
and Geographic Area Information" of the Consolidated Financial Statements in the
Abbott Laboratories Annual  Report for the  year ended December  31, 1994  (1994
Annual  Report), filed as an exhibit to this report. Also incorporated herein by
reference is the text and table of  sales by class of similar products  included
in the section of the 1994 Annual Report captioned "Financial Review."

                       NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

PHARMACEUTICAL AND NUTRITIONAL PRODUCTS

    Included   in  this  segment  is  a   broad  line  of  adult  and  pediatric
pharmaceuticals and  nutritionals.  These products  are  sold primarily  on  the
prescription or recommendation of physicians or other health care professionals.
The   segment   also   includes  agricultural   and   chemical   products,  bulk
pharmaceuticals, and consumer products.

    Principal   pharmaceutical    and   nutritional    products   include    the
anti-infectives  clarithromycin, sold in  the United States  under the trademark
Biaxin-Registered Trademark- and outside the  United States primarily under  the
trademark  Klacid-Registered Trademark-,  and tosufloxacin, sold  in Japan under
the trademark Tosuxacin-TM-; various forms of the antibiotic erythromycin,  sold
primarily   as  PCE-Registered   Trademark-  or   polymer  coated  erythromycin,
Erythrocin-Registered Trademark-, and  E.E.S.-Registered Trademark-; agents  for
the  treatment of  epilepsy, including  Depakote-Registered Trademark-;  a broad
line of  cardiovascular  products,  including  Loftyl-Registered  Trademark-,  a
vasoactive  agent sold outside the  United States; Hytrin-Registered Trademark-,
used  as  an  anti-hypertensive  and  for  the  treatment  of  benign  prostatic
hyperplasia;    Abbokinase-Registered    Trademark-,   a    thrombolytic   drug;
Survanta-Registered Trademark-, a bovine derived lung surfactant; various  forms
of   prepared   infant   formula,   including   Similac-Registered   Trademark-,
Isomil-Registered   Trademark-,   Alimentum-Registered   Trademark-,   Toddler's
Best-TM-,  and  NeoCare-TM-;  and  other  medical  and  pediatric  nutritionals,
including  Ensure-Registered  Trademark-,  Ensure  Plus-Registered   Trademark-,
Ensure-Registered   Trademark-   High  Protein,   Jevity-Registered  Trademark-,
Glucerna-Registered Trademark-, Advera-Registered Trademark-,
PediaSure-Registered Trademark-, Pedialyte-Registered Trademark-,
Pulmocare-Registered  Trademark-   and  Gain-Registered   Trademark-.   Consumer
products   include  the  dandruff  shampoo  Selsun  Blue-Registered  Trademark-;
Murine-Registered   Trademark-    eye    care    and    ear    care    products;
Tronolane-Registered Trademark- hemorrhoid medication; and
Faultless-Registered  Trademark-  rubber sundry  products.  Agricultural, animal
health,  and  chemical  products  include  plant  growth  regulators,  including
ProGibb-Registered Trademark-; herbicides; larvicides, including
VectoBac-Registered Trademark-; and biologically derived insecticides, including
DiPel-Registered Trademark- and XenTari-Registered Trademark-.

    Pharmaceutical  and  nutritional  products are  generally  sold  directly to
retailers, wholesalers, health care facilities, and government agencies. In most
cases, they are  distributed from Company-owned  distribution centers or  public
warehouses.  Certain products are  co-marketed with other  companies. In certain
overseas countries, some of these products are marketed and distributed  through
distributors.  Primary  marketing  efforts  for  pharmaceutical  and nutritional
products are directed toward securing the prescription or recommendation of  the
Company's brand of products by physicians or other health care professionals. In
the  United  States  managed  care purchasers,  for  example  health maintenance
organizations (HMOs) and  pharmacy benefit managers,  are becoming  increasingly
important  customers.  Competition  is  generally  from  other  broad  line  and
specialized health care  manufacturers. A significant  aspect of competition  is
the search for technological

* As  used throughout  the text  of this  Report, the  term "Company"  refers to
  Abbott Laboratories, an Illinois corporation,  or Abbott Laboratories and  its
  consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires.

                                       1

innovations.  The introduction  of new  products by  competitors and  changes in
medical  practices  and  procedures  can  result  in  product  obsolescence.  In
addition,  the  substitution  of  generic drugs  for  the  brand  prescribed has
increased competitive pressures on pharmaceutical products.

    Consumer  products  are  promoted  directly   to  the  public  by   consumer
advertising.  These  products  are  generally  sold  directly  to  retailers and
wholesalers. Competitive products  are sold  by other  diversified consumer  and
health   care  companies.  Competitive  factors  include  consumer  advertising,
scientific innovation, price, and availability of generic product forms.

    Agricultural, animal  health and  chemical products  are generally  sold  to
agricultural distributors, animal health companies and pharmaceutical companies.
Competition  is primarily  from large  chemical, animal  health and agricultural
companies. Competition  is based  on numerous  factors depending  on the  market
served.  Competitive factors  include product  performance, quality,  price, and
technological advantages.

    The  Company  is   the  leading   worldwide  producer   of  the   antibiotic
erythromycin.  Similac-Registered  Trademark-  is  the  leading  infant  formula
product in the United States.

    Under an agreement between the Company and Takeda Chemical Industries,  Ltd.
of  Japan  (Takeda), TAP  Pharmaceuticals Inc.  (TAP), owned  50 percent  by the
Company and 50  percent by  Takeda, develops and  markets in  the United  States
products  based on Takeda research. TAP markets Lupron-Registered Trademark-, an
LH-RH analog, and Lupron Depot-Registered  Trademark-, a sustained release  form
of Lupron-Registered Trademark-, in the United States. These agents are used for
the   treatment  of  advanced  prostatic   cancer,  endometriosis,  and  central
precocious puberty.  The Company  also has  marketing rights  to certain  Takeda
products   in  select   Latin  American   markets.  The   Company  also  markets
Lupron-Registered Trademark-,  Lupron  Depot-Registered Trademark-,  and  Lupron
Depot-Ped-Registered Trademark- in select markets outside the United States.

HOSPITAL AND LABORATORY PRODUCTS

    Hospital and laboratory products include diagnostic systems for blood banks,
hospitals,   commercial   laboratories,   and   alternate-care   testing  sites;
intravenous  and  irrigation  fluids   and  related  administration   equipment,
including  electronic drug  delivery systems;  drugs and  drug delivery systems;
anesthetics; critical care  products; and other  medical specialty products  for
hospitals and alternate-care sites.

    The  principal products included in this segment are parenteral (intravenous
or  I.V.)  solutions   and  related   administration  equipment   sold  as   the
LifeCare-Registered Trademark- line of products,
LifeShield-Registered Trademark- needleless products, and
Venoset-Registered    Trademark-   products;   irrigating   fluids;   parenteral
nutritionals such as Aminosyn-Registered Trademark- and
Liposyn-Registered Trademark-; Plum-Registered Trademark- and
Omni-Flow-Registered Trademark- electronic  drug delivery  systems; Abbott  Pain
Manager-Registered   Trademark-;  patient-controlled  analgesia  (PCA)  systems;
venipuncture products; hospital injectables including
FirstChoice-Registered Trademark-  generics;  premixed  I.V.  drugs  in  various
containers; ADD-Vantage-Registered Trademark- and Nutrimix-Registered Trademark-
drug  and  nutritional delivery  systems; Anne-Registered  Trademark- anesthetic
infusion  systems;  anesthetics,   including  Pentothal-Registered   Trademark-,
isoflurane  and enflurane;  Calcijex-Registered Trademark-,  an injectable agent
for treatment of bone disease  in hemodialysis patients; critical care  products
including Opticath-Registered Trademark- for oximetry,
Transpac-Registered Trademark- for hemodynamic monitoring, and specialty cardiac
products;  screening  tests  for  hepatitis B,  HTLV-1,  hepatitis  B  core, and
hepatitis C; tests  for detection  of AIDS  antibodies and  antigens, and  other
infectious  disease detection  systems; tests  for determining  levels of abused
drugs with the  ADx-Registered Trademark-  instrument; physiological  diagnostic
tests;  cancer monitoring tests  including tests for  prostate specific antigen;
laboratory   tests   and   therapeutic   drug   monitoring   systems   such   as
TDx-Registered   Trademark-;   clinical   chemistry  systems   such   as  Abbott
Spectrum-Registered   Trademark-,    Abbott    Spectrum-Registered    Trademark-
EPx-Registered  Trademark-, Abbott  Spectrum-Registered Trademark-  CCx-TM-, and
Quantum-TM-; AxSym-Registered  Trademark-, Commander-Registered  Trademark-  and
IMx-Registered  Trademark- lines of diagnostic instruments and chemical reagents
used  with  immunoassay  diagnostics;  Abbott  Vision-Registered  Trademark-,  a
desk-top  blood analyzer;  the Abbott TestPack-Registered  Trademark- system for
diagnostic testing; a full line of hematology systems and reagents known as  the
Cell-Dyn-Registered Trademark- series; and Abbott Maestro-TM-, a data management
system.

    The  Company markets hospital  and laboratory products  in the United States
and  many  other  countries.  These   products  are  generally  distributed   to
wholesalers  and directly  to hospitals,  laboratories, and  physicians' offices
from   distribution   centers   maintained    by   the   Company.   Sales    are

                                       2
<PAGE>
also  made in the  home infusion services market  directly to patients receiving
treatment outside the hospital through marketing arrangements with hospitals and
other health  care  providers.  Overseas  sales  are  made  either  directly  to
customers or through distributors, depending on the market served.

    The hospital and laboratory products industry segment is highly competitive,
both  in the United States and overseas.  This segment is subject to competition
in technological  innovation, price,  convenience  of use,  service,  instrument
warranty  provisions,  product  performance,  long-term  supply  contracts,  and
product  potential  for  overall  cost  effectiveness  and  productivity  gains.
Products  in  this segment  can be  subject to  rapid product  obsolescence. The
Company has benefitted from technological  advantages of certain of its  current
products;  however, these advantages may be reduced or eliminated as competitors
introduce new products.

    The Company  is  one of  the  leading  domestic manufacturers  of  I.V.  and
irrigating   solutions   and   related   administration   equipment,  parenteral
nutritional products, anesthesia products, and drug delivery systems. It is also
the worldwide leader in in  vitro diagnostic products, including thyroid  tests,
therapeutic  drug monitoring, cancer monitoring  tests, diagnostic tests for the
detection of hepatitis and AIDS antibodies, and immunodiagnostic instruments.

         INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS IN GENERAL

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS

    The Company purchases,  in the  ordinary course of  business, necessary  raw
materials  and  supplies essential  to  the Company's  operations  from numerous
suppliers in  the  United  States  and  overseas.  There  have  been  no  recent
availability problems or significant supply shortages.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, AND LICENSES

    The Company is aware of the desirability for patent and trademark protection
for  its  products.  The Company  owns,  has  applications pending  for,  and is
licensed under a  substantial number  of patents.  Accordingly, where  possible,
patents and trademarks are sought and obtained for the Company's products in the
United  States and  all countries  of major  marketing interest  to the Company.
Principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed in the  Narrative
Description  of Business on pages  1, 2 and 3.  These, and various patents which
expire during the period 1995 to 2015,  in the aggregate, are believed to be  of
material  importance in  the operation of  the Company's  business. Although the
Company believes that no single patent, license, trademark (or related group  of
patents,  licenses,  or trademarks)  is material  in  relation to  the Company's
business as a whole, clarithromycin  is increasingly important to the  Company's
Pharmaceutical  and Nutritional Products industry  segment. On December 8, 1994,
the  President  signed   the  Uruguay  Round   Agreements  Act  (P.L.   103-465)
implementing  the Uruguay  Round of the  General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade
(GATT). Prior to such implementation, the patent on clarithromycin was scheduled
to expire in the United States in 2003. The intellectual property provisions  of
GATT appear to extend this expiration date to 2005.

SEASONAL ASPECTS, CUSTOMERS, BACKLOG, AND RENEGOTIATION

    There  are no  significant seasonal aspects  to the  Company's business. The
incidence of  certain  infectious  diseases  which occur  at  various  times  in
different  areas of the world does, however, affect the demand for the Company's
anti-infective products. Orders for the Company's products are generally  filled
on a current basis, and order backlog is not material to the Company's business.
No  single  customer accounted  for sales  equaling  10 percent  or more  of the
Company's consolidated net sales. No material portion of the Company's  business
is  subject  to renegotiation  of  profits or  termination  of contracts  at the
election of the government.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

    The  Company  spent  $963,516,000  in   1994,  $880,974,000  in  1993,   and
$772,407,000  in  1992 on  research  to discover  and  develop new  products and
processes and to improve existing products and processes. The Company  continues
to concentrate research expenditures in pharmaceutical and diagnostic products.

                                       3
<PAGE>
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

    The  Company believes  that its operations  comply in  all material respects
with  applicable  laws  and  regulations  concerning  environmental  protection.
Regulations   under  federal  and  state  environmental  laws  impose  stringent
limitations  on  emissions  and  discharges  to  the  environment  from  various
manufacturing  operations. The Company's capital  and operating expenditures for
pollution control  in  1994 were  approximately  $20 million  and  $41  million,
respectively.  Capital  and  operating expenditures  for  pollution  control are
estimated to approximate $16 million and $38 million, respectively, in 1995.

    The Company is participating as one of many potentially responsible  parties
in  investigation and/ or remediation at nine locations in the United States and
Puerto Rico under  the Comprehensive Environmental  Response, Compensation,  and
Liability  Act, commonly known as Superfund.  The aggregate costs of remediation
at these sites by all identified parties are uncertain but have been subject  to
widely ranging estimates totaling as much as several hundred million dollars. In
many  cases, the Company believes that the actual costs will be lower than these
estimates, and  the  fraction  for  which the  Company  may  be  responsible  is
anticipated to be considerably less and will be paid out over a number of years.
The  Company expects  to participate  in the  investigation or  cleanup at these
sites. The Company is also voluntarily investigating potential contamination  at
five  Company-owned  sites,  and  has initiated  voluntary  remediation  at four
Company-owned sites,  in cooperation  with the  Environmental Protection  Agency
(EPA) or similar state agencies.

    While  it is not feasible to predict with certainty the costs related to the
previously described investigation and cleanup activities, the Company  believes
that  such costs, together  with other expenditures  to maintain compliance with
applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should  not
have  a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows,
or results of operations.

EMPLOYEES

    The Company employed 49,464 persons as of December 31, 1994.

REGULATION

    The development,  manufacture,  sale,  and  distribution  of  the  Company's
products  are subject  to comprehensive  government regulation,  and the general
trend is  toward more  stringent regulation.  Government regulation  by  various
federal,  state, and local  agencies, which includes  detailed inspection of and
controls over research and  laboratory procedures, clinical investigations,  and
manufacturing,  marketing,  sampling, distribution,  recordkeeping,  storage and
disposal practices,  substantially increases  the  time, difficulty,  and  costs
incurred in obtaining and maintaining the approval to market newly developed and
existing  products. Government regulatory  actions can result  in the seizure or
recall of  products, suspension  or revocation  of the  authority necessary  for
their production and sale, and other civil or criminal sanctions.

    Continuing  studies of the utilization, safety,  and efficacy of health care
products and  their  components  are being  conducted  by  industry,  government
agencies,  and  others. Such  studies,  which employ  increasingly sophisticated
methods and  techniques, can  call into  question the  utilization, safety,  and
efficacy  of previously marketed  products and in some  cases have resulted, and
may in the future  result, in the discontinuance  of marketing of such  products
and  give rise  to claims for  damages from  persons who believe  they have been
injured as a result of their use.

    The cost  of  human  health care  products  continues  to be  a  subject  of
investigation  and  action  by governmental  agencies,  legislative  bodies, and
private organizations in the  United States and other  countries. In the  United
States,  most states have enacted  generic substitution legislation requiring or
permitting a  dispensing pharmacist  to  substitute a  different  manufacturer's
version  of a pharmaceutical  product for the one  prescribed. Federal and state
governments continue to press efforts to  reduce costs of Medicare and  Medicaid
programs,  including restrictions on amounts agencies will reimburse for the use
of products. Manufacturers  must pay certain  statutorily-prescribed rebates  on
Medicaid  purchases for reimbursement on prescription drugs under state Medicaid
plans. In addition,  the Federal  government follows  a diagnosis-related  group
(DRG) payment system for certain

                                       4
<PAGE>
institutional  services  provided under  Medicare  or Medicaid.  The  DRG system
entitles a health  care facility  to a  fixed reimbursement  based on  discharge
diagnoses  rather  than  actual  costs incurred  in  patient  treatment, thereby
increasing the incentive for the facility  to limit or control expenditures  for
many  health  care  products. The  Veterans  Health  Care Act  of  1992 requires
manufacturers to  extend  additional  discounts on  pharmaceutical  products  to
various   federal  agencies,  including  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs,
Department of Defense, and Public Health Service entities and institutions.

    In the United States, governmental cost-containment efforts have extended to
the federally subsidized Special Supplemental  Food Program for Women,  Infants,
and  Children (WIC). All states participate in  WIC and have sought and obtained
rebates from manufacturers  of infant  formula whose  products are  used in  the
program.  All of the  states have also conducted  competitive bidding for infant
formula contracts which require the use of specific infant formula products  for
the  state WIC program. The Child Nutrition  and WIC Reauthorization Act of 1989
requires all states participating in WIC to engage in competitive bidding or  to
use  any other cost containment measure that  yields savings equal to or greater
than the savings generated by a competitive bidding system.

    Governmental regulatory agencies now require manufacturers to pay additional
fees. Under the Prescription  Drug User Fee  Act of 1992,  the Federal Food  and
Drug Administration imposes substantial fees on various aspects of the approval,
manufacture  and  sale  of  prescription  drugs.  Congress  is  now  considering
expanding  user  fees  to  medical  devices.  The  Company  believes  that  such
legislation, if enacted, will add considerable expense for the Company.

    The  Company expects debate to continue during  1995 at both the federal and
the state  level over  the availability,  method of  delivery, and  payment  for
health  care products and services. The  Company believes that if legislation is
enacted, it could have the  effect of reducing prices,  or reducing the rate  of
price  increases,  for health  and medical  insurance  and medical  products and
services.

    International operations  are  also  subject  to  a  significant  degree  of
government   regulation.   Many  countries,   directly  or   indirectly  through
reimbursement limitations,  control  the  selling  price  of  most  health  care
products.  Furthermore, many developing  countries limit the  importation of raw
materials and finished products. International regulations are having an  impact
on  United  States  regulations,  as well.  The  International  Organization for
Standardization ("ISO") provides the  voluntary criteria for regulating  medical
devices within the European Economic Community. The Food and Drug Administration
("FDA")  has  announced that  it  will attempt  to  harmonize its  regulation of
medical devices with that  of the ISO. Recently  published changes to the  FDA's
regulations governing the manufacture of medical devices appear to encompass and
exceed  the ISO's approach to regulating  medical devices. The FDA's adoption of
the ISO's approach to regulation  and other changes to  the manner in which  the
FDA  regulates medical devices  will increase the cost  of compliance with those
regulations.

    Efforts to  reduce health  care costs  are also  being made  in the  private
sector.  Health  care  providers  have  responded  by  instituting  various cost
reduction and containment measures.

    It is not possible to predict the extent to which the Company or the  health
care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above.

                            INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

    The   Company  markets  products  in  approximately  130  countries  through
affiliates and distributors.  Most of  the products discussed  in the  preceding
sections of this report are sold outside the United States. In addition, certain
products  of  a local  nature  and variations  of  product lines  to  meet local
regulatory requirements and marketing preferences are manufactured and  marketed
to  customers outside the United States. International operations are subject to
certain additional  risks inherent  in conducting  business outside  the  United
States,  including  price and  currency exchange  controls, changes  in currency
exchange rates,  limitations  on  foreign participation  in  local  enterprises,
expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    The  Company is involved  in various claims  and legal proceedings including
(as of January 31,  1995) 24 antitrust suits,  one shareholder derivative  suit,
and  7 investigations  in connection  with the  Company's sale  and marketing of
infant formula products,  62 antitrust  suits in connection  with the  Company's
pricing  of prescription pharmaceuticals,  and 143 product  liability cases that
allege injuries to  the offspring  of women  who ingested  a synthetic  estrogen
(DES)   during  pregnancy.  These  remaining  DES  cases  are  ordinary  routine
litigation that is  incidental to the  business of the  Company. The Company  is
also  involved  in  a  civil administrative  proceeding  involving  the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA").

    The infant formula antitrust  suits allege that  the Company conspired  with
one  or more of its competitors to fix prices for infant formula and to restrain
trade and monopolize  the market  for infant  formula products  in violation  of
state  and federal  antitrust laws.  The suits  have been  brought on  behalf of
individuals, the Nestle Food Company, and state government agencies and name the
Company, certain other infant formula manufacturers and, in some instances,  the
American  Academy of  Pediatrics as defendants.  The cases  seek treble damages,
civil penalties and other relief. The Company has previously reported that cases
are pending in  each of the  following state courts:  Calhoun County and  Shelby
County,  Alabama; Boulder County, Colorado;  Okaloosa County, Florida; St. Clair
County,  Illinois;  Sedgwick  County,  Kansas;  Parish  of  West  Baton   Rouge,
Louisiana;  Calhoun County, Michigan; Hennepin County, Minnesota; Holmes County,
South Dakota; Harrison County and Travis County, Texas (2 cases); Kanwaha,  West
Virginia;  and,  Milwaukee County,  Wisconsin (2  cases).  The cases  which were
pending in  Florida and  in  Colorado have  now  been dismissed  on  defendants'
motion.  In addition, on  October 27, 1994, a  case was filed  in state court in
Jefferson County, Kentucky; on October 28, 1994, a case was filed in state court
in Burleigh County,  North Dakota; on  November 21,  1994, a case  was filed  in
state  court in Jackson County, North Carolina; on December 22, 1994, a case was
filed in state court in Suffolk County, Massachusetts; and on January 18,  1995,
a  case  was filed  in Holmes  County, Mississippi  by the  Mississippi Attorney
General. Three  of these  cases have  now  been removed  to federal  court:  the
Kentucky  case is  pending in federal  court in Louisville,  Kentucky, the North
Dakota case  is pending  in federal  court in  Bismarck, North  Dakota, and  the
Massachusetts  case is  pending in  federal court  in Boston,  Massachusetts. On
November 29,  1994,  the  Attorney  General  of  Wisconsin  sought  the  court's
permission  to intervene in both of the cases which are pending in the Wisconsin
state courts.  Although each  of the  cases  which are  pending in  state  court
purports  to  be a  state  consumer class  action,  the court  has  denied class
certification in the case that is pending  in Michigan. The case brought by  the
Nestle  Food Company is pending in federal  court in Los Angeles, California and
is scheduled for trial on May 9,  1995. The plaintiff is seeking treble  damages
and  asserts single damages of $257 million.  The remaining cases are pending in
federal  courts  in  Birmingham,   Alabama,  Tallahassee,  Florida,   Knoxville,
Tennessee,  and Reno,  Nevada and  all purport  to be  state-wide consumer class
actions. The Company  has filed or  intends to file  a response to  each of  the
complaints  denying all substantive allegations. The shareholder derivative suit
is pending in state court in Cook  County, Illinois, names all of the  Company's
present  directors (other than Allen F. Jacobson) and a former executive officer
as defendants and alleges that the  defendants breached their fiduciary duty  to
the  Company by permitting antitrust violations in connection with the Company's
sale and marketing of infant formula  products. The plaintiffs seek to hold  the
defendants  liable for an amount exceeding  $140 million, in connection with the
Company's settlement  of  certain  anti-trust  litigation  arising  out  of  its
marketing  of  infant formula.  The investigations  are  being conducted  by the
Attorneys General of the states of California, Connecticut, Minnesota, New York,
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and by the Canadian Bureau of Competition Policy. The
Canadian investigation is both civil and criminal in its scope.

    The prescription pharmaceutical pricing antitrust suits allege that  various
pharmaceutical  manufacturers  have  conspired to  fix  prices  for prescription
pharmaceuticals and/or  to  discriminate  in pricing  to  retail  pharmacies  by
providing  discounts to mail-order pharmacies, institutional pharmacies and HMOs
in violation of state and federal antitrust laws. The suits have been brought on
behalf

                                       7
<PAGE>
of individuals  and  retail pharmacies  and  name  both the  Company  and  other
pharmaceutical  manufacturers as well as pharmaceutical wholesalers and at least
one mail-order pharmacy company  as defendants. The  cases seek treble  damages,
civil  penalties and other  relief. The Company  has filed or  intends to file a
response to  each of  the  complaints denying  all substantive  allegations.  On
February  4, 1994, all  of the then  pending prescription pharmaceutical pricing
antitrust cases were consolidated  in the United States  District Court for  the
Northern  District of Illinois  under the Multidistrict  Litigation Rules. These
cases are now known as IN RE: BRAND NAME PRESCRIPTION DRUG ANTITRUST LITIGATION,
MDL 997. As of September  30, 1994, the Company was  named in 15 federal  cases,
all  of which were consolidated in the MDL 997 litigation and in 13 state cases.
Three of these state cases were subsequently dismissed. The 10 other state cases
are pending in the following state courts: Greene County, Alabama; San Francisco
County, California (7  cases); Dane  County, Wisconsin;  and Washington  County,
Wisconsin.  One additional purported class action was filed on January 16, 1995,
in King  County,  Washington on  behalf  of Washington  consumers.  Thirty-three
additional  cases have been filed in federal  court since September 30, 1994 and
have now been  or will be  consolidated in the  MDL 997 litigation.  Two of  the
cases  which are pending in the MDL  997 litigation were filed as class actions:
one on behalf of retail  pharmacies and one on  behalf of Alabama consumers.  In
November  the court hearing the MDL  997 litigation certified a nationwide class
of retail pharmacies which had purchased prescription drug products from any one
or more of  the defendants during  the period  October 1989 to  the present  and
refused  to certify a statewide class of Alabama consumers who had purchased the
defendant's prescription pharmaceuticals.

    On February  23, 1994,  the United  States Environmental  Protection  Agency
("the  EPA") instituted a civil administrative  proceeding by filing a complaint
alleging that the Company burned hazardous  waste at its North Chicago  facility
in  violation of the  RCRA. The complaint  seeks penalties of  $991,775. The EPA
simultaneously issued  an Administrative  Order requiring  the Company  to  take
certain  actions to ensure future compliance with the RCRA. The Company filed an
answer to the complaint denying all substantive allegations.

    While it is  not feasible  to predict the  outcome of  such pending  claims,
proceedings,  and investigations  with certainty,  management is  of the opinion
that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.

             SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To Abbott Laboratories:

    We  have audited in  accordance with generally  accepted auditing standards,
the financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report incorporated by
reference in this Form  10-K, and have issued  our report thereon dated  January
13,  1995. Our audits were  made for the purpose of  forming an opinion on those
statements taken as a whole. Schedule II is the responsibility of the  Company's
management,  is  presented for  purposes of  complying  with the  Securities and
Exchange Commission's rules, and is not part of the basic financial  statements.
This  schedule  has been  subjected to  the auditing  procedures applied  in the
audits of the basic financial statements  and, in our opinion, fairly states  in
all  material respects the  financial data required  to be set  forth therein in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

                                                             ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

                                   ARTICLE I

                                    OFFICES

          The principal office of the Corporation in the State of Illinois shall
be located at the intersection of State Routes 43 and 137 in the County of Lake.
The Corporation may have such other offices either within or without the State
of Illinois as the business of the Corporation may require from time to time.

          The registered office of the Corporation may be, but need not be,
identical with the principal office in the State of Illinois.  The address of
the registered office may be changed from time to time by the Board of
Directors.


                                   ARTICLE II

                                  SHAREHOLDERS

          SECTION 1.  ANNUAL MEETING; TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS, NOMINATION OF
DIRECTORS.  The annual meeting of the shareholders shall be held in the month of
April in each year on such date and at such time as the Board of Directors shall
provide.  The meeting shall be held for the purpose of electing Directors and
for the transaction of such other business as is properly brought before the
meeting in accordance with these By-Laws.  If the election of Directors shall
not be held on the day designated for any annual meeting, or at any adjournment
thereof, the Board of Directors shall cause the election to be held at a meeting
of the shareholders as soon thereafter as conveniently may be.

          To be properly brought before the meeting, business must be either (a)
specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at
the direction of the Board of Directors, (b) otherwise properly brought before
the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (c) otherwise
properly brought before the meeting by a shareholder.  In addition to any other
applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an annual
meeting by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof
in writing to the Secretary.  To be timely, a shareholder's notice must be
delivered to or mailed and received at the principal office of the Corporation,
not earlier than October 1 nor later than February 15 immediately prior to the
date of the meeting; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event that the date of such
meeting is not in the month of April and less than sixty-five days' notice or
prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to
shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so received not
later than the close of business on the fifteenth day following the day on which
such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public
disclosure was made, whichever first occurs.  A shareholder's notice to the
Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring
before the annual meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be
brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business
at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and record address of the shareholder
proposing such business, (iii) the class and number of shares of the

Corporation which are beneficially owned by the shareholder and (iv) any
material interest of the shareholder in such business.

          Notwithstanding anything in these By-Laws to the contrary, no business
shall be conducted at the annual meeting except in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 1, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing in this
Section 1 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any shareholder of any
business properly brought before the annual meeting.

          The Chairman of an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant,
determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought
before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1, and if
he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and such business not
properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.

          Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following
procedures shall be eligible for election as directors.  Nominations of persons
for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation at the annual meeting
may be made at such annual meeting of shareholders by or at the direction of the
Board of Directors, by any nominating committee or person appointed by the Board
of Directors, or by any shareholder of the Corporation entitled to vote for the
election of directors at such meeting who complies with the notice procedures
set forth in this Section 1.  Such nominations, other than those made by or at
the direction of the Board of Directors or by a committee or person appointed by
the Board of Directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to
the Secretary.  To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered to or
mailed and received at the principal office of the Corporation not earlier than
October 1 nor later than February 15 immediately prior to that date of the
meeting; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event that the date of such meeting is
not in the month of April and less than sixty-five days' notice or prior public
disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice
by the shareholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of
business on the fifteenth day following the day on which such notice of the date
of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever first
occurs.  Such shareholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth:  (a) as to
each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or re-
election as a director, (i) the name, age, business address and residence
address of the person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of the
person, (iii) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation
which are beneficially owned by the person and (iv) any other information
relating to the person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations for
proxies for election of directors pursuant to Regulation 14A under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and (b) as to the shareholder
giving the notice, (i) the name and record address of such shareholder and (ii)
the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned
by such shareholder.  The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to
furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation
to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as director of
the Corporation.  No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the
Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth herein.


          The Chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and
declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the
foregoing procedure, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the
meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.

          SECTION 2.  SPECIAL MEETINGS.  Special meetings of the shareholders
may be called by the Chairman of the Board, the President, the Board of
Directors or by the holders of not less than one-fifth of all the outstanding
shares entitled to vote on the matter for which the meeting is called.

          SECTION 3.  PLACE OF MEETING.  The Board of Directors may designate
any place, either within or without the State of Illinois, as the place of
meeting for any annual meeting or for any special meeting called by the Board of
Directors.  If no designation is made, or if a special meeting be otherwise
called, the place of meeting shall be the principal office of the Corporation in
the State of Illinois.

          SECTION 4.  NOTICE OF MEETINGS.  Written notice stating the place, day
and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered not less than ten
nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting, or in the case of a
merger, consolidation, share exchange, dissolution or sale, lease or exchange of
assets not less than twenty nor more than sixty days before the meeting, either
personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board, the
President, or the Secretary or the persons calling the meeting, to each
shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting.  If mailed, such notice
shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail,
addressed to the shareholder at his or her address as it appears on the records
of the Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid.

          SECTION 5.  FIXING RECORD DATE.  For the purpose of determining
shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders, or
shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a
determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of
Directors of the Corporation may fix in advance a date as the record date for
any such determination of shareholders, such date in any case to be not more
than sixty days and, for a meeting of shareholders, not less than ten days, or
in the case of a merger, consolidation, share exchange, dissolution or sale,
lease or exchange of assets not less than twenty days, immediately preceding
such meeting.

           SECTION 6.  VOTING LISTS.  The Secretary shall make, or cause to have
made, within twenty days after the record date for a meeting of shareholders or
ten days before such meeting, whichever is earlier, a complete list of the
shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting, arranged in alphabetical order,
with the address of and the number of shares held by each, which list, for a
period of ten days prior to such meeting, shall be kept on file at the
registered office of the Corporation and shall be subject to inspection by any
shareholder and to copying at the shareholder's expense, at any time during
usual business hours.  Such list shall also be produced and kept open at the
time and place of the meeting and shall be subject to the inspection of any
shareholder during the whole time of the meeting.  The original share ledger or
transfer book, or a duplicate thereof kept in this State, shall be prima facie
evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to examine such list or share
ledger or transfer book or to vote at any meeting of shareholders.

          SECTION 7.  QUORUM.  A majority of the outstanding shares of the
Corporation, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a
meeting of shareholders;

<PAGE>

BY-LAWS                                                                   Page 4


provided, that if less than a majority of the shares are represented at said
meeting, a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting from
time to time without further notice.  If a quorum is present, the affirmative
vote of the majority of the shares represented at the meeting shall be the act
of the shareholders, unless the vote of a greater number or voting by classes is
required by The Business Corporation Act of 1983 or the Articles of
Incorporation.

          SECTION 8.  PROXIES.  A shareholder may appoint a proxy to vote or
otherwise act for the shareholder by signing an appropriate form and delivering
it to the person so appointed; provided, however, no shareholder may name more
than three persons as proxies to attend and to vote the shareholder's shares at
any meeting of shareholders.  No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of
eleven months from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy.
Each proxy continues in full force and effect until revoked by the person
executing it prior to the vote pursuant thereto, except as otherwise provided by
law.  Such revocation may be effected by a writing delivered to the Secretary of
the Corporation stating that the proxy is revoked or by a subsequent proxy
executed by, or by attendance at the meeting and voting in person by, the person
executing the proxy.  The dates contained on the forms of proxy presumptively
determine the order of execution, regardless of the postmark dates on the
envelopes in which they were mailed.

          SECTION 9.  VOTING OF SHARES.  Each outstanding share, regardless of
class, shall be entitled to one vote in each matter submitted to a vote at a
meeting of shareholders and, in all elections for Directors, every shareholder
shall have the right to vote the number of shares owned by such shareholder for
as many persons as there are Directors to be elected, or to cumulate such votes
and give one candidate as many votes as shall equal the number of Directors
multiplied by the number of such shares or to distribute such cumulative votes
in any proportion among any number of candidates; provided that, vacancies on
the Board of Directors may be filled as provided in Section 9, Article III of
these By-Laws.  A shareholder may vote either in person or by proxy.

          SECTION 10.  VOTING OF SHARES BY CERTAIN HOLDERS.  Shares of this
Corporation held by the Corporation in a fiduciary capacity may be voted and
shall be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares entitled
to vote at any given time.

          Shares registered in the name of another corporation, domestic or
foreign, may be voted by any officer, agent, proxy or other legal representative
authorized to vote such shares under the law of incorporation of such
corporation.

          Shares registered in the name of a deceased person, a minor ward or a
person under legal disability may be voted by his or her administrator,
executor, or court appointed guardian, either in person or by proxy without a
transfer of such shares into the name of such administrator, executor, or court
appointed guardian.  Shares registered in the name of a trustee may be voted by
him or her, either in person or by proxy.

          Shares registered in the name of a receiver may be voted by such
receiver, and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by
such receiver without the transfer thereof into his or her name if authority so
to do is contained in an appropriate order of the court by which such receiver
was appointed.

          A shareholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such
shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, and
thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred.

          SECTION 11.  VOTING BY BALLOT.  Voting on any question or in any
election may be viva voce unless the presiding officer shall order that voting
be by ballot.

          SECTION 12.  INSPECTORS OF ELECTION.  The Board of Directors in
advance of any meeting of shareholders may appoint inspectors to act at such
meeting or any adjournment thereof.  If inspectors of election are not so
appointed, the officer or person acting as chairman at any such meeting may, and
on the request of any shareholder or his proxy, shall make such appointment.  In
case any person appointed as inspector shall fail to appear or to act, the
vacancy may be filled by appointment made by the Board of Directors in advance
of the meeting or at the meeting by the officer or person acting as chairman.

          Such inspectors shall ascertain and report the number of shares
represented at the meeting, based upon their determination of the validity and
effect of proxies; count all votes and report the results; and do such other
acts as are proper to conduct the election and voting with impartiality and
fairness to all the shareholders.

          Each report of an inspector shall be in writing and signed by him or
her or by a majority of them if there be more than one inspector acting at such
meeting.  If there is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be
the report of the inspectors.  The report of the inspector or inspectors on the
number of shares represented at the meeting and the results of the voting shall
be prima facie evidence thereof.


                                   ARTICLE III

                                    DIRECTORS

          SECTION l.  GENERAL POWERS.  The business and affairs of the
Corporation shall be managed under the direction of the Board of Directors.

          SECTION 2.  NUMBER, TENURE AND QUALIFICATIONS.  The number of
Directors of the Corporation shall be thirteen.  The terms of all Directors
shall expire at the next annual meeting of shareholders following their
election.  Despite the expiration of a Director's term, he or she shall continue
to serve until the next meeting of shareholders at which Directors are elected.
Directors need not be residents of Illinois or shareholders of the Corporation.

          SECTION 3.  REGULAR MEETINGS.  A regular annual meeting of the Board
of Directors shall be held without other notice than this By-Law, immediately
after, and at the same place as, the annual meeting of shareholders.  Other
regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at the principal office
of the Corporation on the second Friday of every month at 9:00 a.m. without
other notice than this By-Law.  The Board of Directors may provide, by
resolution, for the holding of the regular monthly meetings at a different time
and place, either within or

<PAGE>

BY-LAWS                                                                   Page 6


without the State of Illinois, or for the omission of the regular monthly
meeting altogether.  Where the Board of Directors has, by resolution, changed or
omitted regular meetings, no other notice than such resolution shall be given.

          SECTION 4.  SPECIAL MEETINGS.  Special meetings of the Board of
Directors may be called by or at the request of the Chairman of the Board, the
Chairman of the Executive Committee, the President, or of any four Directors.
The persons authorized to call special meetings of the Board of Directors may
fix any place, either within or without the State of Illinois, as the place for
holding any special meeting of the Board of Directors.

          SECTION 5.  NOTICE.  Notice of any special meeting shall be given at
least one day prior thereto if notice is given personally or at least two days
prior thereto if notice is given by mail or telegram.  If mailed, such notice
shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail
addressed to the Director at his business address, with postage thereon prepaid.
If notice be given by telegram, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when
the telegram so addressed is delivered to the telegraph company.  Any Director
may waive notice of any meeting by signing a written waiver of notice either
before or after the meeting.  Attendance of a Director at any meeting shall
constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a Director attends a
meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business
because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Neither the business to
be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the
Board of Directors need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such
meeting.

          SECTION 6.  QUORUM.  A majority of the number of Directors fixed by
these By-Laws shall constitute a quorum for transaction of business at any
meeting of the Board of Directors; provided, that if less than a majority of
such number of Directors are present at said meeting, a majority of the
Directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further
notice.

          SECTION 7.  MANNER OF VOTING.  The act of the majority of the
Directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of
the Board of Directors.

          SECTION 8.  INFORMAL ACTION BY DIRECTORS.  Any action required to be
taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any other action which may be
taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof, may be
taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so
taken, shall be signed by all of the Directors entitled to vote with respect to
the subject matter thereof, or by all the members of such committee, as the case
may be.

          The consent shall be evidenced by one or more written approvals, each
of which sets forth the action taken and bears the signature of one or more
Directors.  All the approvals evidencing the consent shall be delivered to the
Secretary of the Corporation to be filed in the corporate records.  The action
taken shall be effective when all the Directors have approved the consent unless
the consent specifies a different effective date.

          Any such consent signed by all the Directors or all the members of a
committee shall have the same effect as a unanimous vote.

          SECTION 9.  VACANCIES.  Any vacancy occurring in the Board of
Directors and any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the
number of Directors, may be filled by election at an annual meeting or at a
special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose.  A Director elected to
fill a vacancy shall serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders.  A
majority of Directors then in office may also fill one or more vacancies arising
between meetings of shareholders by reason of an increase in the number of
Directors or otherwise, and any Director so selected shall serve until the next
annual meeting of shareholders, provided that at no time may the number of
Directors selected to fill vacancies in this manner during any interim period
between meetings of shareholders exceed 33-1/3 per cent of the total membership
of the Board of Directors.

          SECTION 10.  PRESUMPTION OF ASSENT.  A Director of the Corporation who
is present at a meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof at
which action on any corporate matter is taken is conclusively presumed to have
assented to the action taken unless his or her dissent is entered in the minutes
of the meeting or unless he or she files his or her written dissent to such
action with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting before the
adjournment thereof or forwards such dissent by registered or certified mail to
the Secretary of the Corporation immediately after the adjournment of the
meeting.  Such right to dissent shall not apply to a Director who voted in favor
of such action.

          SECTION 11.  APPOINTMENT OF AUDITORS.  Upon the recommendation of the
Audit Committee, the Board of Directors shall appoint annually a firm of
independent public accountants as auditors of the Corporation.  Such appointment
shall be submitted to the shareholders for ratification at the Annual Meeting
next following such appointment.  Should the holders of a majority of the shares
represented at the meeting fail to ratify the appointment of any firm as
auditors of the Corporation, or should the Board of Directors for any reason
determine that such appointment be terminated, the Board of Directors shall
appoint another firm of independent public accountants to act as auditors of the
Corporation and such appointment shall be submitted to the shareholders for
ratification at the Annual or Special Shareholders Meeting next following such
appointment.


                                   ARTICLE IV

create one or more committees and appoint members of the Board to serve on the
committee or committees.  Each committee shall have three or more members, who
serve at the pleasure of the Board.  The Board shall designate one member of
each committee to be chairman of the committee.  The Board shall designate a
secretary of each committee who may be, but need not be, a member of the
committee or the Board.

          SECTION 2.  COMMITTEE MEETINGS.  A majority of any committee shall
constitute a quorum and a majority of the committee is necessary for committee
action.  A committee may act by unanimous consent in writing without a meeting.
Committee meetings may be called by the

          SECTION 3.  EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.  The Board shall appoint an Executive
Committee.  A majority of the members of the Committee shall be selected from
those Directors who are not then serving as full-time employees of the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries.

          SECTION 4.  DUTIES OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.  The Executive
Committee may, when the Board of Directors is not in session, exercise the

Corporation; provided, however, the Committee may not:

of shares or determine the designation and relative rights, preferences, and
limitations of a series of shares, except that the Board may direct the
Committee to fix the specific terms of the issuance or sale or contract for sale
or the number of shares to be allocated to particular employees under an
employee benefit plan; or

          (9)  amend, alter, repeal, or take action inconsistent with any
resolution or action of the Board of Directors when the resolution or action of
the Board of Directors provides by its terms that it shall not be amended,
altered or repealed by action of the Committee.

          SECTION 5.  AUDIT COMMITTEE.  The Board of Directors shall appoint an
Audit Committee.  All of the members of the Committee shall be selected from
those Directors who are not then serving as full-time employees of the

NOTE:     For the purpose of calculating this ratio, (i) earnings have been
          calculated by adjusting net earnings for taxes on earnings; interest
          expense; capitalized interest cost, net of amortization; minority
          interest; and the portion of rentals representative of the interest
          factor, (ii) the Company considers one-third of rental expense to be
          the amount representing return on capital, and (iii) fixed charges
          comprise total interest expense, including capitalized interest and
          such portion of rentals.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent
company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions.  The
accounts of foreign subsidiaries are consolidated as of November 30.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     Cash equivalents consist of time deposits and certificates of deposit with
original maturities of three months or less.

INVENTORIES

     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or
market.  Cost includes material and conversion costs.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

     Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets.

PRODUCT LIABILITY

     Provisions are made for the portions of probable losses that are not
covered by product liability insurance.

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS

     For foreign operations in highly inflationary economies, translation gains
and losses are included in other (income) expense, net.  For remaining foreign
operations, translation adjustments are included as a component of shareholders'
investment.

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

     Earnings per common share amounts are computed using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

     The Company recognizes revenue from product sales upon shipment to
customers.  Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, and returns and
other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are
recorded.

Note 2 - Taxes on Earnings
(dollars in thousands)

     Deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of
temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
financial reporting amounts.  Prior to 1993, provisions were made for the
estimated amount of income taxes on reported earnings which were payable
currently and in the future.  The effect of this change on income before taxes
and net income was not significant, and prior years' financial statements have
not been restated.

     U.S. income taxes are provided on those earnings of foreign subsidiaries
and subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico under tax incentive grants, which are
intended to be remitted to the parent company.  Undistributed earnings
reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries as working capital and plant and
equipment aggregated $820,000 at December 31, 1994.  Deferred income taxes not
provided on these earnings are not significant.

     Earnings before taxes, and the related provisions for taxes on earnings,
are as follows:

Note 3 - Financial Instruments

     The Company enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to
hedge intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the functional
currency of the lending and borrowing entities are not the same.  Such contracts
are also used to hedge foreign currency denominated third party trade payables
and receivables.  For intercompany loans, the contracts require the Company to
sell foreign currencies, primarily Japanese yen and European currencies, in
exchange for primarily U.S. dollars.  For intercompany and trade payables and
receivables, the currencies hedged are primarily the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen
and European currencies.  At December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992, the Company held
$717 million, $477 million and $400 million, respectively, of foreign currency
forward exchange contracts.  The contracts outstanding at December 31, 1994
mature in 1995.  These contracts are marked to market each month.  The resulting
gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or
gains on the exposures being hedged.

     The Company purchases U.S. dollar call options as a hedge of anticipated
intercompany purchases by foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not
the U.S. dollar.  These contracts give the Company the right, but not the
requirement, to purchase U.S. dollars in exchange for foreign currencies,
primarily Japanese yen and European currencies, at predetermined exchange rates.
At December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992, the Company held $370 million, $59 million
and $28 million, respectively, of U.S. dollar call option contracts.  The
contracts outstanding at December 31, 1994 mature in 1995.  Realized and
unrealized gains and losses on contracts that qualify as hedges of anticipated
purchases by foreign subsidiaries are recognized in the same period that the
foreign currency exposure is recognized.  Contracts that do not qualify for
hedge accounting are marked to market each month.

     The Company purchases foreign currency put options as a hedge against the
effect of exchange rate fluctuations on income.  These contracts give the
Company the right, but not the requirement, to sell foreign currencies,
primarily Japanese yen and European currencies, in exchange for U.S. dollars at
predetermined exchange rates.  These contracts are marked to market each month.
The resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset
by losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.  There were no such contracts
outstanding at December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992.

     The Company manages its exposure to short-term interest rate changes by
entering into interest rate swap contracts which effectively convert the
floating interest rate on a portion of the Company's commercial paper borrowings
to fixed rates.  At December 31, 1994 and 1993, the Company held a $200 million
contract which matures in August, 1995 and at December 31, 1992, held contracts
totaling $300 million.  For 1994, the average floating rate received was 4.45%
and the fixed rate paid was 4.72%.  Gains or losses are recognized in income in
the same period that the interest rate exposure is recognized.

     The gross unrealized holding gains/(losses) on current investment
securities and those maturing after one year totalled $2.5 million and $(9.2)
million at December 31, 1994, respectively.

Note 4 - Benefit Plans
(dollars in thousands)

Retirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution, and medical
and dental plans.

      Pension benefits for the Company's defined benefit plans generally are
based on the employee's years of service and compensation near retirement.
Certain plan benefits would vest and certain restrictions on the use of plan
assets would take effect upon a change in control of the Company.

      Net pension cost for the Company's significant defined benefit plans
includes the following components:

The discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions
are identical to those used for the Company's major defined benefit plan.  A 9
percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care
benefits was assumed for 1995.  This rate is assumed to decrease gradually to 5
percent in year 2000 and remain at that level thereafter.  A one-percentage-
point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase the
accumulated post-retirement benefit obligations as of December 31, 1994 by
approximately $82,000 and the total of the service and interest cost components
of net post-retirement health care cost for the year then ended by approximately
$15,700.

     The Company also provides certain other post-employment benefits, primarily
salary continuation plans, to qualifying domestic employees, and accrues for the
related cost over the service lives of the employees.

Note 6 - Incentive Stock Program

     The 1991 Incentive Stock Program authorizes the granting of stock options,
stock appreciation rights, limited stock appreciation rights, restricted stock
awards, performance units, and foreign qualified benefits.  Stock options,
limited stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, and foreign
qualified benefits have been granted and are currently outstanding under this
program and prior programs.  The purchase price of the shares under option must
be at least 100 percent of the fair market value of the common stock on the date
of grant.

     Limited stock appreciation rights have been granted to certain holders of
stock options and can be exercised, by surrendering related stock options, only
upon a change in control of the Company.  At December 31, 1994, 4,388,359
options, with purchase prices from $6.31 to $32.69 per share, were subject to
limited stock appreciation rights.  Upon a change in control of the Company, all
outstanding stock options become fully exercisable, and all terms and conditions
of all restricted stock awards are deemed satisfied.

     At December 31, 1994, 12,116,674 shares were reserved for future grants
under the 1991 Program.

     Data with respect to stock options under the 1991 Program and prior
programs are as follows:

Note 9 - Litigation and Environmental Matters

The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings including
numerous antitrust suits and investigations in connection with the sale and
marketing of infant formula products and the pricing of prescription
pharmaceuticals.

     The Company is also involved in numerous product liability cases, many of
which allege injuries to the offspring of women who ingested a synthetic
estrogen (DES) during pregnancy.  In addition, the Company has been identified
as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a
number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal
remediation laws and is voluntarily investigating potential contamination at a
number of Company-owned locations.

     The matters above are discussed more fully in Item 1, Business -
Environmental Matters, and Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in the Annual Report on
Form 10-K, which is available upon request.

     While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending claims,
proceedings, investigations and remediation activities with certainty,
management is of the opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows, or
results of operations.

Note 10 - Other Significant Events

In June 1992, the Company voluntarily withdrew from the worldwide market its
quinolone anti-infective, temafloxacin, and recorded a charge of $215  million
for costs associated with this withdrawal.  In the second quarter 1993, the
Company resolved various contingencies relative to the temafloxacin withdrawal
and recorded a credit of $70 million for these items.

      In the first quarter 1993, the Company sold its peritoneal dialysis
product line.  The gain on the sale is reported in other (income) expense, net.
In May 1992, the Company sold its 20 percent investment in Boston Scientific
Corporation for a pretax gain of $272 million.

      In December, 1994 a United Kingdom subsidiary of the Company purchased the
operating assets of the nutritional business of Puleva Union Industrial y
Agroganadera, S.A. for $106 million.  Had this acquisition taken place on
January 1, 1994, consolidated sales and net income would not have been
significantly different from reported amounts.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(a)   Net sales and operating profit were not significantly impacted by the
      fluctuations in the U.S. dollar in 1994.  In 1993, net sales and operating
      profit were unfavorably affected by the relatively stronger U.S. dollar,
      while 1992 was favorably affected by the relatively weaker U.S. dollar.

(b)   The 1992 operating profit was unfavorably impacted by the pretax charge
      of $215 for costs associated with the voluntary withdrawal of temafloxacin
      from the worldwide market.  The 1993 operating profit was favorably
      impacted by the $70 pretax credit resulting from resolution of various
      contingencies related to the withdrawal.  The operating profit for 1993
      was unfavorably impacted by the $104 pretax charge reflecting the
      settlement of certain claims and legal proceedings in connection with the
      sale and marketing of infant formula products.  In 1994, a similar pretax
      amount was charged against earnings for other pending and settled
      litigation.

(c)   The 1993 operating profit was favorably impacted by the gain on the sale
      of the peritoneal dialysis product line.

(d)   Corporate expenses not allocated to segments include results from joint
      ventures, minority interest expenses, net foreign exchange losses, and
      other general corporate income and expense.  Net foreign exchange losses
      were $30.8 in 1994, $41.3 in 1993, and $93.2 in 1992.

(e)   General corporate assets are principally prepaid income taxes, cash and
      cash equivalents, investment securities, and investments in joint
      ventures.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To the Shareholders of Abbott Laboratories:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Abbott
Laboratories (an Illinois corporation) and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994,
1993, and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of earnings,
shareholders' investment, and cash flows for the years then ended.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Abbott Laboratories and
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

                        AUDIT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN'S REPORT


     The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is composed of six non-
employee directors.  The Audit Committee oversees the Company's financial
reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors.  The Committee held two
meetings during 1994.  In fulfilling its responsibility, the Committee
recommended to the Board of Directors, subject to shareholder approval, the
selection of the Company's independent public accountants.  The Audit Committee
discussed with the internal auditors and the independent public accountants the
overall scope and specific plans for their respective audits.  The Committee
also discussed the Company's consolidated financial statements and the adequacy
of the Company's internal controls.  During the Audit Committee meetings the
Committee met with the internal auditors and independent public accountants,
without management present, to discuss the results of their audits, their
evaluations of the Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the
Company's financial reporting.  The meetings also were designed to facilitate
any private communication with the Committee desired by the internal auditors or
independent public accountants.

                    MANAGEMENT REPORT ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


     Management has prepared and is responsible for the Company's consolidated
financial statements and related notes.  They have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles and necessarily include amounts
based on judgments and estimates by management.  All financial information in
this annual report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements.

     The Company maintains internal accounting control systems and related
policies and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are
safeguarded, that transactions are executed in accordance with management's
authorization and properly recorded, and that accounting records may be relied
upon for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and other
financial information.  The design, monitoring, and revision of internal
accounting control systems involve, among other things, management's judgment
with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of specific control
measures.  The Company also maintains an internal auditing function which
evaluates and formally reports on the adequacy and effectiveness of internal
accounting controls, policies, and procedures.

     The Company's consolidated financial statements have been audited by
independent public accountants who have expressed their opinion with respect to
the fairness of these statements.

consolidated net sales in at least one of the last three years were:

Anti-Infectives..................................     994       784       685
</TABLE>


Worldwide sales of infant formula increased in 1994 primarily due to net price
increases, and in 1993 primarily due to unit growth.  Fluids and equipment sales
increased in 1994 primarily due to unit growth, and decreased in 1993 due to the
sale of a product line.  Increases in medical nutritionals and anti-infectives
were primarily due to unit increases.

OPERATING EARNINGS

Gross profit margins (sales less cost of products sold, including freight and
distribution expenses) were 56.4 percent of sales in 1994, 56.2 percent in 1993,
and 55.4 percent in 1992.  Productivity improvements, favorable product mix and
net price increases in some product lines offset the impacts of inflation and
competitive pricing pressures in other product lines.  Fluctuations in the U.S.
dollar had an insignificant impact on gross profit margins in 1994.  In 1993,
gross profit margins were unfavorably impacted by the relatively stronger U.S.
dollar while 1992 was favorably affected by the relatively weaker U.S. dollar.
In the U.S., states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula
under the federally subsidized Special Supplemental Food Program for Women,
Infants, and Children (WIC).  The WIC rebate programs continue to have a
negative effect on the gross profit margins of this portion of the infant
formula business.

     Research and development expense increased to $964 million in 1994, and
represented 10.5 percent of net sales in 1994 and 1993, and 9.8 percent of net
sales in 1992.  Research and development expenditures continue to be
concentrated on diagnostic and pharmaceutical products.

                      Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries

                          FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)


     Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3.3 percent in 1994,
compared to increases of 8.5 percent in 1993, and 21.1 percent in 1992.  The
1994 increase reflects a higher level of selling and marketing to support
pharmaceutical and nutritional new product launches.  The 1993 increase reflects
a pretax charge to earnings of approximately $104 million for the settlement of
certain claims and legal proceedings in connection with the sale and marketing
of infant formula products.  A similar amount was charged against earnings in
1994 for other pending and settled litigation.  The 1992 increase resulted from
higher levels of selling and marketing expenditures for support of
pharmaceutical and diagnostic new product launches.

     In June 1992, the Company voluntarily withdrew from the worldwide market
its quinolone anti-infective, temafloxacin, and recorded a pretax charge of
$215 million for costs associated with this withdrawal.  In 1993, the Company
resolved various contingencies relative to the temafloxacin withdrawal and
recorded a pretax credit to earnings of $70 million for these items.

NON-OPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSE

Other (income) expense, net, includes net foreign exchange losses of $30.8
million in 1994, $41.3 million in 1993, and $93.2 million in 1992, including net
exchange (gains) losses on foreign currency contracts.  These contracts were
purchased to manage the Company's exposure to foreign currency rate changes.
Other (income) expense, net, also includes the Company's share of the income
from joint ventures, primarily TAP Pharmaceuticals Inc., and, in 1993, the gain
on the sale of the Company's peritoneal dialysis product line.

In May 1992, the Company sold its 20 percent investment in Boston Scientific
Corporation for a pretax gain of $272 million.  Net proceeds from the sale were
used toward the purchase of eight million shares of the Company's common stock.

TAXES ON EARNINGS

The Company's effective income tax rate for 1994 was 30.0 percent, compared to
28.0 percent for 1993 and 28.7 percent for 1992.  The 1994 tax rate was impacted
by the reduction in tax incentive grants for Puerto Rico operations.  The 1993
tax rate was impacted by the increase in the statutory U.S. Federal income tax
rate.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

CASH FLOW

The Company expects positive cash flow from operating activities to continue to
approximate or exceed the Company's capital expenditures and cash dividends.

DEBT AND CAPITAL

The Company has maintained its favorable bond ratings (AAA by Standard & Poor's
Corporation and Aa1 by Moody's Investors Service) and continues to have readily
available financial resources, including unused domestic lines of credit of
$300 million at December 31, 1994.  These lines of credit support domestic
commercial paper borrowing arrangements.

                          FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)


     In 1993, the Company filed a registration statement with the Securities and
Exchange Commission for the issuance of $500 million of senior debt securities
and issued $200 million of 5.6% notes due 2003.  Net proceeds were used to
retire short-term borrowings and for the purchase of the Company's common
shares.  The Company may issue up to an additional $300  million of debt
securities in the future under this registration statement.

     During the last three years, the Company purchased 58,080,000 of its common
shares at a cost of $1.689 billion, including 6,630,000 shares of the 20,000,000
shares authorized for purchase by the Board of Directors in September 1994.

Capital expenditures of $929 million in 1994, $953 million in 1993, and $1.0
billion in 1992, were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing and
research and development facilities in both segments and for administrative
support facilities.  This level of capital expenditures is expected to continue
over the next few years, with a relatively equal proportion dedicated to each
segment.

BUSINESS ACQUISITION

In December, 1994 a United Kingdom subsidiary of the Company purchased the
operating assets of the nutritional business of Puleva Union Industrial y
Agroganadera, S.A. for $106 million.  This acquisition will allow the Company to
strengthen its market position in Spain and in other countries in southern
Europe.  Had this acquisition taken place on January 1, 1994, consolidated sales
and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts.

LEGISLATIVE ISSUES

The Company's primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial
government regulation and the trend is toward more stringent regulation.  The
Company expects debate to continue during 1995 at both the federal and the state
level over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care
products and services.  The Company believes that if legislation is enacted, it
could have the effect of reducing prices, or reducing the rate of price
increases, for health and medical insurance and medical products and services.
International operations are also subject to a significant degree of government
regulation.  It is not possible to predict the extent to which the Company or
the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors
in the future.  A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in
Item 1, Business, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is available upon
request.
