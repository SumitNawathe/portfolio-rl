              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                  JUNE 30, 1994

                                   (UNAUDITED)


NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PREPARATION:

The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and footnote
disclosures normally included in audited financial statements.  However, in the
opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments)
necessary to present fairly the financial position, cash flows, and results of
operations have been made.  It is suggested that these statements be read in
conjunction with the financial statements included in the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993.


NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE:

Earnings per common share amounts are computed by using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding.  These shares averaged 816,763,000 for the
six months ended June 30, 1994 and 832,840,000 for the same period in 1993.


NOTE 3 - TAXES ON EARNINGS:

Taxes on earnings reflect estimated annual effective tax rates.  The effective
tax rates are less than the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate principally
due to tax incentive grants related to subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico and
Ireland.  The increase in the effective tax rate from 28 percent in 1993 to 30
percent in 1994 is due primarily to the increase in the statutory U.S. Federal
income tax rate and the reduction in the tax incentive grants for operations in
Puerto Rico.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 1994
(Unaudited), Continued


NOTE 4 - LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:

The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings including
numerous antitrust suits and investigations in connection with the sale and
marketing of infant formula and pharmaceutical products.

The Company is also involved in numerous product liability cases, many of which
allege injuries to the offspring of women who ingested a synthetic estrogen
(DES) during pregnancy.  In addition, the Company has been identified as a
potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of
locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal remediation laws
and is voluntarily investigating potential contamination at a number of Company-
owned locations.

The matters above are discussed more fully in Item 1, Business - Environmental
Matters, and Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, which
is available upon request, and in Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings, in this
Form.

While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending claims,
proceedings, investigations and remediation activities with certainty,
management is of the opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.


NOTE 5 - OTHER SIGNIFICANT EVENTS:

In June 1992, the Company voluntarily withdrew from the worldwide market its
quinolone anti-infective, temafloxacin, and recorded a charge for costs
associated with this withdrawal.  In the second quarter 1993, the Company
resolved various contingencies relative to the temafloxacin withdrawal and
recorded a credit for these items.

FINANCIAL REVIEW


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS 1994 COMPARED WITH
SAME PERIODS IN 1993

Worldwide sales for the second quarter and first six months increased 6.3
percent and 7.3 percent, respectively, over the comparable 1993 periods.  Net
earnings increased 8.8 percent and 7.4 percent, respectively, for the second
quarter and first six months 1994.  Earnings per share increased 9.5 percent and
9.6 percent, respectively, for the second quarter and first six months 1994.

Gross profit margin (sales less cost of products sold, including freight and
distribution expenses) of 57.0 percent for the second quarter was slightly down
from 57.2 percent in the second quarter of 1993 due to product mix.  First half
gross margin of 56.8 percent was up from 55.8 percent one year ago.  The year-
to-date increase is primarily due to favorable product mix and productivity
improvements.

Research and development expenses were $245.0 million and $471.8 million for the
second quarter and first six months 1994, respectively.  This represented 11.1
percent and 10.7 percent of net sales, compared to 10.2 percent and 10.1 percent
in 1993.  The majority of research and development expenditures continues to be
concentrated on pharmaceutical and diagnostic products.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter and first
six months 1994 decreased (15.6) percent and (5.3) percent, respectively, over
the comparable 1993 periods.  The decreases reflect the settlement in May 1993
of certain claims and legal proceedings in connection with the sale and
marketing of infant formula products.  The Company recorded a pre-tax charge to
earnings of approximately $104 million in the second quarter of 1993 in
connection with these settlements.

During the second quarter of 1993, the Company resolved various contingencies
relative to the temafloxacin withdrawal.  The Company recorded a pre-tax credit
to earnings of $70 million for these items.

Other (income) expense, net, includes net foreign exchange losses of $15.3
million and $27.5 million, respectively, for the second quarter and first six
months 1994 compared with net foreign exchange losses of $14.9 million and $19.2
million, respectively, for the corresponding prior year periods.  Also included
in the first six months of 1993 is the gain on the sale of the Company's
peritoneal dialysis product line.

The effective income tax rate increased from 28 percent in 1993 to 30 percent in
1994 due primarily to the increase in the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate
and the reduction in tax incentive grants for Puerto Rico operations.

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

Industry segment sales for the second quarter and first six months 1994 and the
related change from the comparable 1993 periods are shown in the table below.
The Pharmaceutical and Nutritional Products segment includes a broad line of
adult and pediatric pharmaceuticals and nutritionals, which are sold primarily
on the prescription or recommendation of physicians or other health care
professionals; consumer products; agricultural and chemical products; and bulk
pharmaceuticals.  The Hospital and Laboratory Products segment includes
diagnostic systems for blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories and
alternate-care testing sites; intravenous and irrigation fluids and related
administration equipment; drugs and drug delivery systems; anesthetics; critical
care products; and other medical specialty products for hospitals and alternate-
care sites.

Domestic and international sales for the second quarter and first six months
1994 reflect unit growth, and international sales were adversely affected 2.7
percent and 3.5 percent, respectively, due to the relatively stronger U.S.
dollar.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AT JUNE 30, 1994
COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 1993
- - ------------------------------------------------

Net cash from operating activities for the first six months 1994 totaled $1.020
billion.  The Company expects annual cash flow from operating activities to
continue to approximate or exceed the Company's capital expenditures and cash
dividends.

The Company has maintained its favorable bond ratings (AAA by Standard & Poor's
Corporation and Aa1 by Moody's Investors Service) and continues to have readily
available financial resources, including unused domestic lines of credit of $300
million at June 30, 1994.

During the first six months 1994, the Company continued its program to purchase
its common shares.  The Company purchased and retired 10,625,000 shares during
this period at a cost of $306 million.  As of June 30, 1994, an additional
3,476,000 shares may be purchased in future periods under authorization granted
by the Board of Directors in September 1993.


LEGISLATIVE ISSUES

The Company's primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial
government regulation.  In the U.S., comprehensive legislation may be enacted
that could make significant changes to the availability, delivery and payment
for health care products and services.  International operations are also
subject to a significant degree of government regulation.  It is not possible to
predict the extent to which the Company or the health care industry in general
might be adversely affected by these factors in the future.  A more complete
discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, in the Annual
Report on Form 10-K, which is available upon request.

                         PART II.      OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

          The Company's 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 1994 described 13
antitrust suits and 6 investigations (as of March 31, 1994) regarding the
Company's marketing and sale of infant formula products.  On May 27, 1994, after
a 5-week trial, the federal court in the District of Columbia District found the
Company innocent of anticompetitive conduct as charged by the Federal Trade
Commission (the "Commission") and dismissed the case that had been brought by
the Commission.  Seven new antitrust suits regarding the Company's marketing and
sale of infant formula products have commenced since March 31,1994: on April
1,1994, a case was filed in state court in Boulder County, Colorado; on April 6,
1994, a case was filed in state court in Blount County, Tennessee (this case has
been removed by the defendants to federal court in the Eastern District of
Tennessee); on April 26, 1994, a case was filed in state court in St. Clair
County, Illinois; on April 26, 1994, a case was filed in state court in Kanwaha
County, West Virginia; on April 27, 1994, a case was filed in federal court in
the District of Nevada; on May 4, 1994, a case was filed in state court in
Hennepin County, Minnesota; and, on May 6, 1994, a case was filed in state court
in Holmes County, South Dakota.  Each purports to be a state consumer class
action; alleges violation of either state antitrust laws, trade practices laws,
or both; asks for unspecified actual and/or punitive damages, injunctive relief,
and declaratory judgment; and names the Company and certain other infant formula
manufacturers as defendants.  In June 1994 the Canadian Bureau of Competition
Policy broadened its previously reported civil investigation to include a
criminal inquiry of the infant formula industry's marketing practices.  The
Company intends to defend itself in these suits and investigations and to deny
all substantive allegations.  As of June 30, 1994, there are 19 antitrust suits
and 6 investigations pending in connection with the Company's sale and marketing
of infant formula products.

          The Company's 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 1994 described 16
antitrust suits (as of March 31, 1994) regarding the pricing of prescription
pharmaceuticals.  Three additional lawsuits were filed after March 31, 1994: on
April 29, 1994, a case was filed in state court in Bullock County, Alabama (this
case has been removed by the defendants to federal court in the Middle District
of Alabama); on May 2, 1994, a case was filed in state court in Greene County,
Alabama; and on May 31, 1994, a case was filed in federal court in the Southern
District of Alabama.  The first two of these cases purport to be statewide class
actions on behalf of Alabama retail pharmacies.  The third is brought by an
individual pharmacy.  The plaintiffs seek unspecified treble damages, attorneys'
fees, and declaratory and injunctive relief and have named the Company and
numerous other pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers as defendants.  As
of June 30, 1994, the Company has been named as a defendant in 19 pending
antitrust suits regarding the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals. The
Company intends to defend itself in these suits and to deny all substantive
allegations.



<PAGE>

          The Company's 1993 10-K disclosed that the Company is participating as
one of many potentially responsible parties in investigation and/or remediation
at eight locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act commonly known as
Superfund.  The Company is now also participating in an investigation and clean-
up at a ninth location.

      NOTE:     For the purpose of calculating this ratio, (i) earnings have
                been calculated by adjusting net earnings for taxes on earnings;
                interest expense; capitalized interest cost, net of
                amortization; minority interest; and the portion of rentals
                representative of the interest factor, (ii) the Company
                considers one-third of rental expense to be the amount
                representing return on capital, and (iii) fixed charges comprise
                total interest expense, including capitalized interest and such
                portion of rentals.
