Note 1 - Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and footnote
disclosures normally included in audited financial statements.  However, in the
opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments)
necessary to present fairly the results of operations, financial position and
cash flows have been made.  It is suggested that these statements be read in
conjunction with the financial statements included in Abbott's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1998.

Note 3 - Taxes on Earnings

Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective tax rates.  The
effective tax rates are less than the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate
principally due to tax incentive grants related to subsidiaries operating in
Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Italy.

Note 4 - Litigation and Environmental Matters

Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings including numerous
antitrust suits and investigations in connection with the pricing of
prescription pharmaceuticals.  These suits and investigations allege that
various pharmaceutical manufacturers have conspired to fix prices for
prescription pharmaceuticals and/or to discriminate in pricing to retail
pharmacies by providing discounts to mail-order pharmacies, institutional
pharmacies and HMOs in violation of state and federal antitrust laws.  The suits
have been brought on behalf of individuals and retail pharmacies and name both
Abbott and certain other pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmaceutical
wholesalers and at least one mail-order pharmacy company as defendants.  The
cases seek treble damages, civil penalties, injunctive and other relief.  
During 1998, settlements were reached in the federal class action lawsuit,
whereby Abbott paid $57 million, and thirteen other separate actions.  Abbott
has filed or intends to file a response to each of the remaining complaints
denying all substantive allegations.

     In addition, Abbott has been identified as a potentially responsible party
for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United
States and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is
investigating potential contamination at a number of Abbott-owned locations.

     The matters above are discussed more fully in Note 14 to the financial
statements included in Abbott's Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is available
upon request, and in Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings, in this Form.

Note 4 - Litigation and Environmental Matters, continued

     Abbott expects that within the next year, legal proceedings will occur
which may result in a change in the estimated reserves recorded by Abbott. 
While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending claims,
proceedings, investigations and remediation activities with certainty,
management is of the opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a
material adverse effect on Abbott's financial position, cash flows, or results
of operations.

As of March 31, 1999, the cumulative net of tax balances for foreign currency
translation loss adjustments and the unrealized (gains) on marketable equity
securities were $340,122, and ($16,234), respectively.

Note 6 - Common Stock Split

On February 13, 1998, the Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split.
Shareholders of record on May 1, 1998, were issued an additional share of
Abbott's common stock on May 29, 1998, for each share owned on the record date. 
All shares and per share data in the condensed consolidated financial statements
and notes have been adjusted to reflect the stock split.

Note 7 - Segment Information
(dollars in millions), continued

     INTERNATIONAL - Non-U.S. sales of all Abbott's pharmaceutical, hospital and
nutritional products.  Products sold by International are manufactured by
domestic segments and by international manufacturing locations.  

     CHEMICAL & AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS - Worldwide sales of chemicals and
agricultural products for crop protection, forestry and animal health and a

     SEGMENT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Abbott's underlying accounting records are
maintained on a legal entity basis for government and public reporting
requirements.  Segment disclosures are on a performance basis consistent with
internal management reporting.  Intersegment transfers of inventory are recorded
at standard cost and are not a measure of segment operating earnings.  The cost
of some corporate functions and the cost of certain employee benefits are sold
to segments at predetermined rates which approximate cost.  Remaining costs, if
any, are not allocated to revenue segments.  The following segment information
has been prepared in accordance with the internal accounting policies of Abbott,
as described above, and may not be presented in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.

* Percentage changes are based on unrounded numbers.
</TABLE>

Domestic and international sales for the first quarter reflect primarily unit
growth.  Total sales were favorably affected 0.1 percent and international sales
were favorably affected 0.2 percent by the relatively weaker U.S. dollar in the
first quarter 1999.  Pharmaceutical segment sales decreased primarily due to
volume shortfalls for Abbokinase and Norvir, as the result of production issues
more fully described below.  Diluted earnings per share for the quarter rose to
43 cents, up 13.2 percent from 38 cents a year ago. Net earnings increased 13.1
percent to $667 million, from $590 million in the first quarter of 1998.

     Gross profit margin (sales less cost of products sold, including freight
and distribution expenses) was 56.1 percent for the 1999 first quarter, compared
to 58.0 percent for the 1998 first quarter.  This decrease was primarily due to
unfavorable product mix, primarily lower sales of pharmaceuticals, higher
manufacturing costs, and inflation.  

     Research and development expenses were $267 million for the first quarter
1999, representing 8.1 percent of net sales, compared to 9.2 percent in 1998. 
The majority of research and development expenditures continues to be
concentrated on pharmaceutical and diagnostic products.

     Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter 1999
were comparable to the prior year.

     Abbott holds patents on Hytrin in the United States and several major
markets throughout the world.  Abbott is facing a number of patent challenges
from generic manufacturers in the United States, and the ultimate outcome of
this litigation cannot be predicted with certainty.  However, Abbott does not
expect a generic form of Hytrin to become available before the end of the third
quarter of 1999.  Abbott believes generic competition would adversely impact
sales of Hytrin.  For the year ended December 31, 1998, Abbott recorded U.S.
sales of Hytrin of $542 million.

     On July 27, 1998, Abbott announced that it was experiencing manufacturing
difficulties with the capsule formulation of its protease inhibitor Norvir.  The
manufacturing difficulties with Norvir have resulted in shortages and
interruption of the supply of capsules.  Abbott is supplying Norvir liquid
formulation to provide continued Norvir therapy for patients.  For the year 
ended December 31, 1998, Abbott recorded sales of Norvir of $250 million.
Abbott is unable to quantify the effect that the production problems will have
on sales in future periods.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
(continued)

     In late 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suspended its 
approval of the release of production lots of Abbott's pharmaceutical product 
Abbokinase due to Current Good Manufacturing Practice concerns raised by the 
FDA following inspections of Abbott and its raw material supplier.  Abbott is 
instituting changes to its procedures in response to the FDA.  In January 
1999, after Abbott revised the product's labeling to add additional warnings 
and the FDA issued a health care provider information sheet, the FDA released 
certain lots that were under its review.  The FDA subsequently established 
new criteria for the release of additional lots.  No additional lots have 
been released.  Abbott cannot predict the effect of this matter on future 
sales of Abbokinase.  For the year ended December 31, 1998, Abbott sold 
approximately $277 million of Abbokinase, primarily in the U.S.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AT MARCH 31, 1999 COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31,
1998

Net cash from operating activities for the first quarter 1999 totaled
$845 million.  Abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to
continue to approximate or exceed Abbott's capital expenditures and cash
dividends.  

     Abbott has maintained its favorable bond ratings (AAA by Standard & Poor's
Corporation and Aa1 by Moody's Investors Service) and continues to have readily
available financial resources, including unused domestic lines of credit of $2.5
billion at March 31, 1999.  These lines of credit support domestic commercial
paper borrowing arrangements.

     Abbott may issue up to $750 million of senior debt securities in the future
under a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
in 1998.

     In December 1998, Abbott suspended purchases of its common shares and
currently has no plans to resume purchases in 1999.

LEGISLATIVE ISSUES

Abbott's primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial
government regulation.  Abbott expects debate to continue at both the federal
and the state levels over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for
health care products and services.  Abbott believes that if legislation is
enacted, it could have the effect of reducing prices, or reducing the rate of
price increases for medical products and services.  International operations are
also subject to a significant degree of government regulation.  It is not
possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in
general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future.  A more
complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, in the
Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is available upon request.

YEAR 2000

The Year 2000 ("Y2K") issue results from the inability of some computer programs
to identify the Year 2000 properly, potentially leading to errors or system
failure.  

     Abbott has organized its efforts to resolve the Y2K issue as follows: 
internal information systems; landlord and embedded systems; electronic products
currently marketed or in the field; and suppliers providing products and
services to Abbott.  Progress goals have been established in each area.  

     Internal information systems were inventoried and assessed, and remediation
started in 1992.  All remediation has been completed.  Eighty-nine percent of
testing has been completed, and all testing is scheduled to be completed by
mid-1999.  Current progress is slightly better than plan.  

     Landlord and embedded systems were inventoried and Y2K assessment completed
by May 1998.  Abbott's goal is to resolve all critical systems by July 1999. 
Current progress is according to plan.

     Abbott has assessed the ability of its medical electronic and software
products to cope with the Y2K issue.  Except for certain products for which
Abbott is the distributor, customers may access Abbott's assessment on Abbott's
Web site.  For i-STAT products and the recently acquired Murex product line, a
referral source for customers to contact the manufacturer is provided on the Web
site.  Most of Abbott's products are not affected by the Y2K issue.  For those
products requiring remediation, Abbott's goal is to provide solutions by June
1999.  Current progress is according to plan.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
(continued)

     Beginning in March 1998, key suppliers were requested to certify that they
were Y2K compliant or, if not, to provide their plans to become compliant. 
Ninety-one percent of suppliers responded; 57 percent of those responding
certified compliance currently and 43 percent forwarded action plans.  Follow-up
with all key suppliers is being conducted according to plan.

     Each of the above areas began developing business continuity plans during
1998.  Abbott's goal is to complete all business continuity plans by September
30, 1999.  Current progress is according to plan.  

     Abbott is in the process of quantifying the amount of sales which might
occur in 1999 due to Y2K that would otherwise occur in 2000.

     The most likely worst-case Y2K scenarios are subject to a wide range of
speculation.  However, the business continuity plans assume Y2K failures are
primarily third party, are intermittent, are of relatively short duration, or
are localized at one site or region, primarily outside the United States.

     Abbott's policy is to expense Y2K remediation costs as incurred.  Y2K
remediation costs from inception through the end of 1999 are expected to
approximate $100 million, of which approximately one-third is expected to be
spent in 1999. 

EURO CONVERSION

On January 1, 1999, the European Economic and Monetary Union took effect and
introduced the euro as the official single currency of the eleven participating
member countries.  On that date the currency exchange rates of the participating
countries were fixed against the euro.  There will be a three-year transition to
the euro, and at the end of 2001, the legacy currencies will be eliminated.  In
1997, Abbott organized an internal cross-functional task force to address the
euro issues and expects to be ready for the full conversion to the euro.  Costs
required to prepare for the euro are not material to Abbott's financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.  The impact, if any, of the euro
on Abbott's competitive position is unknown.

PART II.    OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

        As reported in Abbott's 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 
1998, Abbott is involved in numerous antitrust suits and two investigations 
regarding Abbott's pricing of pharmaceutical products.  As of April 30, 1999, 
116 antitrust suits are pending in federal court and 13 are pending in state 
courts.  The prescription pharmaceutical pricing antitrust suits allege that 
various pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmaceutical wholesalers have 
conspired to fix prices for prescription pharmaceuticals and/or to 
discriminate in pricing to retail pharmacies by providing discounts to 
mail-order pharmacies, institutional pharmacies, and HMOs in violation of 
state and federal antitrust laws.  The suits have been brought on behalf of 
individual consumers and retail pharmacies and name both Abbott and certain 
other pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmaceutical wholesalers and at 
least one mail-order pharmacy company as defendants.  The cases seek treble 
damages, civil penalties and injunctive and other relief.  Abbott has filed 
or intends to file a response to each of the complaints denying all 
substantive allegations.  The federal cases are pending in the United States 
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under the Multidistrict 
Litigation Rules as In re: Brand Name Prescription Drug Antitrust Litigation, 
MDL 997.  The state cases are pending in the following state courts: 
Tuscaloosa County and Clarke County, Alabama; Monterey County, California; 
San Francisco County, California (five cases); San Joaquin County, 
California; Prentiss County, Mississippi; San Miguel County, New Mexico; 
Burleigh County, North Dakota; and Cocke County, Tennessee.  Abbott has 
previously reported that it has entered settlement agreements in the consumer 
lawsuits pending in Johnson County, Kansas; Mecklenburg County, North 
Carolina; and Davidson County, Tennessee and that the court in each 
jurisdiction must approve the agreement before it becomes final.  The courts 
have now approved the settlement agreement in each of those jurisdictions.  
In addition, a settlement agreement for the four consumer cases pending in 
Alameda County, California and San Francisco County, California was approved 
by the court on April 21, 1999.  The amount to be paid in settlement is $6.2 
million (in cash and product).

        As reported in Abbott's 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 
1998, five cases involving Abbott's patents for terazosin hydrochloride, a 
drug that Abbott sells under the trademark Hytrin-Registered Trademark-, are 
pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of 
Illinois.  The other parties to these cases are Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
("Geneva"), Novopharm Limited ("Novopharm"), Invamed, Inc. ("Invamed"), Mylan
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Mylan"), and Warner Chilcott, Inc.  Abbott sued each 
of these five other corporations alleging patent infringement after learning 
that they had applied to the Federal Food and Drug Administration for 
approval for a generic version of terazosin hydrochloride.  Each of these 
corporations contends that Abbott's patent which covers their version of 
terazosin hydrochloride is invalid and unenforceable.  The Geneva, Invamed, 
and Novopharm cases were all pending before the same judge, who, on September 
1, 1998, entered a judgment in each of those cases ruling that the Abbott 
patent at issue in those cases is invalid.  Abbott has appealed this ruling.  
On March 4, 1999, the judge hearing the Mylan case granted Mylan's motion for 
summary judgment, applying the ruling issued September 1 in the Geneva, 
Novopharm and Invamed cases in Mylan's case as well.  Abbott has also 
appealed this ruling. 

        Additionally, in April 1996, Zenith Laboratories, Inc. ("Zenith") 
sued Abbott in the United States District Court for the District of New 
Jersey alleging that Abbott had engaged in unfair competition, abuse of 
process, tortious interference with prospective economic advantage, and fraud 
in attempting to protect Hytrin from generic competition.  Zenith sought 
money damages and a declaration that certain of Abbott's patents covering 
terazosin hydrochloride are invalid.  Abbott filed counterclaims alleging 
patent infringement.  On March 31, 1998, Abbott and Zenith reached an 
agreement that resolved the litigation between the parties.  In the 
settlement, Zenith acknowledged the validity of Abbott's terazosin 
hydrochloride patents and agreed to refrain from selling a generic version of 
terazosin hydrochloride until the expiration of one of Abbott's patents for 
terazosin hydrochloride (U.S. Patent No. 4,251,532).  On April 1, 1998, 
Abbott and Geneva reached an agreement under which Geneva will not market its 
Food and Drug Administration approved generic terazosin hydrochloride 
products until resolution of the pending litigation between the parties.  
Abbott agreed to make quarterly payments to Zenith and monthly payments to 
Geneva until the date on which they may enter the market for terazosin 
hydrochloride under their agreements. Both Zenith and Geneva would be free to 
enter the market for terazosin hydrochloride in the United States, if certain 
of Abbott's patents for terazosin hydrochloride were determined to be invalid 
and if another company legally enters the generic market in the United 
States.  On April 19, 1999, Abbott received a subpoena and a civil 
investigation demand from the Federal Trade Commission regarding these 
agreements with Geneva and Zenith.

        While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending 
claims, proceedings, and investigations with certainty, management is of the 
opinion that their ultimate dispositions should not have a material adverse 
effect on Abbotts financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.

                                      OFFICES

     The principal office of the Corporation in the State of Illinois shall 
be located at the intersection of State Routes 43 and 137 in the County of 
Lake. The Corporation may have such other offices either within or without 
the State of Illinois as the business of the Corporation may require from 
time to time.

     The registered office of the Corporation may be, but need not be, 
identical with the principal office in the State of Illinois.  The address of 
the registered office may be changed from time to time by the Board of 
Directors.

                                    SHAREHOLDERS

     SECTION 1.  ANNUAL MEETING; TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS, NOMINATION OF 
DIRECTORS.  The annual meeting of the shareholders shall be held in the month 
of April in each year on such date and at such time as the Board of Directors 
shall provide.  The meeting shall be held for the purpose of electing 
Directors and for the transaction of such other business as is properly 
brought before the meeting in accordance with these By-Laws.  If the election 
of Directors shall not be held on the day designated for any annual meeting, 
or at any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors shall cause the 
election to be held at a meeting of the shareholders as soon thereafter as 
conveniently may be.

     To be properly brought before the meeting, business must be either 
(a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by 
or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (b) otherwise properly brought 
before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or 
(c) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a shareholder.  In 
addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly 
brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, the shareholder must have
given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary.  To be timely, a 
shareholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the 
principal office of the Corporation, not earlier than October 1 nor later 
than the first business day of January immediately prior to the date of the 
meeting; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event that the date of such meeting 
is not in the month of April and less than sixty-five days' notice or prior 
public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to 
shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so received not 
later than the close of business on the fifteenth day following the day on 
which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public 
disclosure was made, whichever first occurs.  A shareholder's notice to the 
Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring 
before the annual meeting (i) a brief

description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting 
and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the 
name and record address of the shareholder proposing such business, (iii) the 
class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by 
the shareholder and (iv) any material interest of the shareholder in such 
business.

     Notwithstanding anything in these By-Laws to the contrary, no business 
shall be conducted at the annual meeting except in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in this Section 1, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing in 
this Section 1 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any shareholder of 
any business properly brought before the annual meeting.

     The Chairman of an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine 
and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the 
meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1, and if he should 
so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and such business not 
properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.

     Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following 
procedures shall be eligible for election as directors.  Nominations of 
persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation at the 
annual meeting may be made at such annual meeting of shareholders by or at 
the direction of the Board of Directors, by any nominating committee or 
person appointed by the Board of Directors, or by any shareholder of the 
Corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors at such meeting 
who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 1.  Such 
nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the Board of 
Directors or by a committee or person appointed by the Board of Directors, 
shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary.  To be 
timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered to or mailed and received 
at the principal office of the Corporation not earlier than October 1 nor 
later than the first business day of January immediately prior to the date of 
the meeting; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event that the date of such 
meeting is not in the month of April and less than sixty-five days' notice or 
prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to 
shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so received not 
later than the close of business on the fifteenth day following the day on 
which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public 
disclosure was made, whichever first occurs.  Such shareholder's notice to 
the Secretary shall set forth:  (a) as to each person whom the shareholder 
proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director, (i) the name, 
age, business address and residence address of the person, (ii) the principal 
occupation or employment of the person, (iii) the class and number of shares 
of capital stock of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the 
person and (iv) any other information relating to the person that is required 
to be disclosed in solicitations for proxies for election of directors 
pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended;  and (b) as to the shareholder giving the notice, (i) the name and 
record address of such shareholder and (ii) the class and number of shares of 
the Corporation which are beneficially owned by such shareholder.  The 
Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other 
information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the 
eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as

director of the Corporation.  No person shall be eligible for election as a 
director of the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the 
procedures set forth herein.

     The Chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and 
declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the 
foregoing procedure, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to 
the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.

     SECTION 2.  SPECIAL MEETINGS.  Special meetings of the shareholders may 
be called by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the 
President, the Board of Directors or by the holders of not less than 
one-fifth of all the outstanding shares entitled to vote on the matter for 
which the meeting is called.

     SECTION 3.  PLACE OF MEETING.  The Board of Directors may designate any 
place, either within or without the State of Illinois, as the place of 
meeting for any annual meeting or for any special meeting called by the Board 
of Directors.  If no designation is made, or if a special meeting be 
otherwise called, the place of meeting shall be the principal office of the 
Corporation in the State of Illinois.

     SECTION 4.  NOTICE OF MEETINGS.  Written notice stating the place, day 
and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or 
purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered not less than 
ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting, or in the cases 
of a merger, consolidation, share exchange, dissolution or sale, lease or 
exchange of assets not less than twenty nor more than sixty days before the 
meeting, either personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the Chairman 
of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, or the Secretary or 
the persons calling the meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to 
vote at such meeting.  If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered 
when deposited in the United States mail, addressed to the shareholder at his 
or her address as it appears on the records of the Corporation, with postage 
thereon prepaid.

     SECTION 5.  FIXING RECORD DATE.  For the purpose of determining 
shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders, 
or shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to 
make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the Board 
of Directors of the Corporation may fix in advance a date as the record date 
for any such determination of shareholders, such date in any case to be not 
more than sixty days and, for a meeting of shareholders, not less than ten 
days, or in the case of a merger, consolidation, share exchange, dissolution 
or sale, lease or exchange of assets not less than twenty days, immediately 
preceding such meeting.

     SECTION 6.  VOTING LISTS.  The Secretary shall make, or cause to have 
made, within twenty days after the record date for a meeting of shareholders 
or ten days before such meeting, whichever is earlier, a complete list of the 
shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting, arranged in alphabetical 
order, with the address of and the number of shares held by each, which list, 
for a period of ten days prior to such meeting, shall be kept on file at the 
registered office of the

Corporation and shall be subject to inspection by any shareholder and to 
copying at the shareholder's expense, at any time during usual business 
hours.  Such list shall also be produced and kept open at the time and place 
of the meeting and shall be subject to the inspection of any shareholder 
during the whole time of the meeting.  The original share ledger or transfer 
book, or a duplicate thereof kept in this State, shall be prima facie 
evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to examine such list or 
share ledger or transfer book or to vote at any meeting of shareholders.

     SECTION 7.  QUORUM.  A majority of the outstanding shares of the 
Corporation entitled to vote on a matter, represented in person or by proxy, 
shall constitute a quorum for consideration of such matter at a meeting of 
shareholders.  If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority 
of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on a matter 
shall be the act of the shareholders, unless the vote of a greater number or 
voting by classes is required by The Business Corporation Act of 1983 or the 
Articles of Incorporation, as in effect on the date of such determination.  
If a quorum is not present, a majority of the shares of the Corporation 
entitled to vote on a matter and represented in person or by proxy at such 
meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice.

     SECTION 8.  PROXIES.  A shareholder may appoint a proxy to vote or 
otherwise act for the shareholder by delivering a valid appointment to the 
person so appointed or such person's agent; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, no shareholder 
may name more than three persons as proxies to attend and to vote the 
shareholder's shares at any meeting of shareholders.  Without limiting the 
manner in which a shareholder may appoint such a proxy pursuant to these 
By-Laws, the following shall constitute valid means by which a shareholder 
may make such an appointment:

     (a)  A shareholder may sign a proxy appointment form.  The shareholder's
          signature may be affixed by any reasonable means, including, but not
          limited to, by facsimile signature.

     (b)  A shareholder may transmit or authorize the transmission of a
          telegram, cablegram, or  other means of electronic transmission;
          provided that any such transmission must either set forth or be
          submitted with information from which it can be determined that the
          telegram, cablegram, or other electronic transmission was authorized
          by the shareholder.  If it is determined that the telegram, cablegram,
          or other electronic transmission is valid, the inspectors or, if there
          are no inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall
          specify the information upon which they relied.

No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of eleven months from the date 
thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy.  Each proxy continues in full 
force and effect until revoked by the person appointing the proxy prior to 
the vote pursuant thereto, except as otherwise provided by law.  Such 
revocation may be effected by a writing delivered to the secretary of the 
Corporation stating that the proxy is revoked or by a subsequent delivery of 
a valid proxy by, or

by the attendance at the meeting and voting in person by the person 
appointing the proxy.  The dates of the proxy shall presumptively determine 
the order of appointment.

     SECTION 9.  VOTING OF SHARES.  Each outstanding share, regardless of 
class, shall be entitled to one vote in each matter submitted to a vote at a 
meeting of shareholders and, in all elections for Directors, every 
shareholder shall have the right to vote the number of shares owned by such 
shareholder for as many persons as there are Directors to be elected, or to 
cumulate such votes and give one candidate as many votes as shall equal the 
number of Directors multiplied by the number of such shares or to distribute 
such cumulative votes in any proportion among any number of candidates; 
provided that, vacancies on the Board of Directors may be filled as provided 
in Section 9, Article III of these By-Laws.  A shareholder may vote either in 
person or by proxy.

     SECTION 10.  VOTING OF SHARES BY CERTAIN HOLDERS.  Shares of this 
Corporation held by the Corporation in a fiduciary capacity may be voted and 
shall be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares 
entitled to vote at any given time.

     Shares registered in the name of another corporation, domestic or 
foreign, may be voted by any officer, agent, proxy or other legal 
representative authorized to vote such shares under the law of incorporation 
of such corporation.

     Shares registered in the name of a deceased person, a minor ward or a 
person under legal disability may be voted by his or her administrator, 
executor, or court appointed guardian, either in person or by proxy without a 
transfer of such shares into the name of such administrator, executor, or 
court appointed guardian.  Shares registered in the name of a trustee may be 
voted by him or her, either in person or by proxy.

     Shares registered in the name of a receiver may be voted by such 
receiver, and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted 
by such receiver without the transfer thereof into his or her name if 
authority so to do is contained in an appropriate order of the court by which 
such receiver was appointed.

     A shareholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such 
shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, 
and thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so 
transferred.

     SECTION 11.  VOTING BY BALLOT.  Voting on any question or in any 
election may be viva voce unless the presiding officer shall order that 
voting be by ballot.

     SECTION 12.  INSPECTORS OF ELECTION.  The Board of Directors in advance 
of any meeting of shareholders may appoint inspectors to act at such meeting 
or any adjournment thereof.  If inspectors of election are not so appointed, 
the officer or person acting as chairman at any such meeting may, and on the 
request of any shareholder or his proxy, shall make such appointment.  In 
case any person appointed as inspector shall fail to appear or to act, the 
vacancy

may be filled by appointment made by the Board of Directors in advance of the 
meeting or at the meeting by the officer or person acting as chairman.

     Such inspectors shall ascertain and report the number of shares 
represented at the meeting, based upon their determination of the validity 
and effect of proxies; count all votes and report the results; and do such 
other acts as are proper to conduct the election and voting with impartiality 
and fairness to all the shareholders.

     Each report of an inspector shall be in writing and signed by him or her 
or by a majority of them if there be more than one inspector acting at such 
meeting.  If there is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall 
be the report of the inspectors.  The report of the inspector or inspectors 
on the number of shares represented at the meeting and the results of the 
voting shall be prima facie evidence thereof.

     SECTION 1.  GENERAL POWERS.  The business and affairs of the Corporation 
shall be managed under the direction of the Board of Directors.

     SECTION 2.  NUMBER, TENURE AND QUALIFICATIONS.  The number of Directors 
of the Corporation shall be thirteen.  The terms of all Directors shall 
expire at the next annual meeting of shareholders following their election.  
Despite the expiration of a Director's term, he or she shall continue to 
serve until the next meeting of shareholders at which Directors are elected.  
Directors need not be residents of Illinois or shareholders of the 
Corporation.

     SECTION 3.  REGULAR MEETINGS.  A regular annual meeting of the Board of 
Directors shall be held without other notice than this By-Law, immediately 
after, and at the same place as, the annual meeting of shareholders.  Other 
regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at the principal 
office of the Corporation on the second Friday of every month at 9:00 a.m. 
without other notice than this By-Law.  The Board of Directors may provide, 
by resolution, for the holding of the regular monthly meetings at a different 
time and place, either within or without the State of Illinois, or for the 
omission of the regular monthly meeting altogether.  Where the Board of 
Directors has, by resolution, changed or omitted regular meetings, no other 
notice than such resolution shall be given.

     SECTION 4.  SPECIAL MEETINGS.  Special meetings of the Board of 
Directors may be called by or at the request of the Chairman of the Board, 
the Chairman of the Executive Committee, the Chief Executive Officer, the 
President, or of any four Directors.  The persons authorized to call special 
meetings of the Board of Directors may fix any place, either within or 
without the State of Illinois, as the place for holding any special meeting 
of the Board of Directors.

     SECTION 5.  NOTICE.  Notice of any special meeting shall be given:
(i) at least one day prior thereto if the notice is given personally or by an 
electronic transmission, (ii) at least two business days prior thereto if the 
notice is given by having it delivered by a third party entity that provides 
delivery services in the ordinary  course of business and guarantees delivery 
of the notice to the Director no later than the following business day, and 
(iii) at least seven days prior thereto if the notice is given by mail.  For 
this purpose, the term "electronic transmission" may include, but shall not 
be limited to, a telex, facsimile, or other electronic means.  Notice shall 
be delivered to the Director's business address and/or telephone number and 
shall be deemed given upon electronic transmission, upon delivery to the 
third party delivery service, or upon being deposited in the United States 
mail with postage thereon prepaid.  Any Director may waive notice of any 
meeting by signing a written waiver of notice either before or after the 
meeting.  Attendance of a Director at any meeting shall constitute a waiver 
of notice of such meeting, except where a Director attends a meeting for the 
express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the 
meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Neither the business to be 
transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the 
Board of Directors need to be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of 
such meeting.

     SECTION 6.  QUORUM.  A majority of the number of Directors fixed by 
these By-Laws shall constitute a quorum for transaction of business at any 
meeting of the Board of Directors; provided, that if less than a majority of 
such number of Directors are present at said meeting, a majority of the 
Directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further 
notice.

     SECTION 7.  MANNER OF VOTING.  The act of the majority of the Directors 
present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the 
Board of Directors.

     SECTION 8.  INFORMAL ACTION BY DIRECTORS.  Any action required to be 
taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any other action which may 
be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof, may

NOTE:
For the purpose of calculating this ratio, (i) earnings have been
calculated by adjusting net earnings for taxes on earnings; interest expense;
capitalized interest cost, net of amortization; minority interest; and the
portion of rentals representative of the interest factor, (ii) Abbott
considers one-third of rental expense to be the amount representing return on
capital, and (iii) fixed charges comprise total interest expense, including
capitalized interest and such portion of rentals.
