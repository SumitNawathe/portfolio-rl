                                      (UNAUDITED)

NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PREPARATION:

The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and 
footnote disclosures normally included in audited financial statements. 
However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only 
normal adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, cash 
flows, and results of operations have been made. It is suggested that these 
statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in 
the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1996.

NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE:

Earnings per common share amounts are computed by using the weighted average 
number of common shares outstanding. These shares averaged 773,105,000 for 
the six months ended June 30, 1997 and 784,547,000 for the same period in 
1996. The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 128 "Earnings per Share" in February 1997. The 
Company will adopt the Standard beginning with the year ended 1997. The 
adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on the Company's 
reported earnings per share.

NOTE 3 - TAXES ON EARNINGS:

Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective tax rates. The 
effective tax rates are less than the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate 
principally due to tax incentive grants related to subsidiaries operating in 
Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Italy, Ireland, and the Netherlands.

NOTE 4 - LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:

The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings including 
numerous antitrust suits and investigations in connection with the pricing of 
prescription pharmaceuticals. In addition, the Company has been identified as 
a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a 
number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under Federal 
remediation laws and is voluntarily investigating potential contamination at 
a number of Company-owned locations.

The matters above are discussed more fully in Item 1, Business - 
Environmental Matters, and Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in the Annual Report on 
Form 10-K, which is available upon request, and in Part II, Item 1, Legal 
Proceedings, in this Form.

The Company expects that within the next year, progress in the legal 
proceedings described above may cause a change in the estimated reserves 
recorded by the Company. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of 
such pending claims, proceedings, investigations and remediation activities 
with certainty, management is of the opinion that their ultimate disposition 
should not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial 
position, cash flows, or results of operations.

NOTE 5 - ACQUISITIONS:

On April 29, 1997, the Company acquired certain parenteral products 
businesses of Sanofi Pharmaceuticals, Inc., for approximately $200 million. A 
substantial portion of the purchase price was allocated to intangible assets, 
including goodwill, which will be amortized on a straight-line basis over 15 
years. Had this acquisition taken place on January 1, 1996, consolidated 
sales and net income would not have been significantly different from 
reported amounts.

In May 1996, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of MediSense, 
Inc., a manufacturer of blood glucose self-testing products, for 
approximately $867 million in cash. A substantial portion of the purchase 
price was allocated to intangible assets which are being amortized over 25 to 
40 years.

FINANCIAL REVIEW


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS 1997 COMPARED WITH
SAME PERIODS IN 1996

Worldwide sales for the second quarter and first six months increased 7.5 
percent and 9.8 percent, respectively, over the comparable 1996 periods. Net 
earnings increased 10.9 percent and 11.1 percent, respectively, in the second 
quarter and first six months 1997. Earnings per share increased 13.3 percent 
and 13.2 percent, respectively, over the prior year periods.

Gross profit margin (sales less cost of products sold, including freight and 
distribution expenses) was 58.0 percent for the 1997 second quarter, compared 
to 57.6 percent for the 1996 second quarter. This increase is due primarily 
to productivity and cost improvements. First half gross margin was 56.9 
percent, compared to 57.2 percent a year earlier. Higher royalties, project 
expense, and the effect of the relatively stronger U. S. dollar had a 
negative effect on gross profit margins for both periods.

Research and development expenses were $320.1 million and $600.2 million for 
the second quarter and first six months 1997, respectively. Research and 
development represented 11.0 percent and 10.2 percent of net sales, compared 
to 11.3 percent and 10.7 percent in 1996. The majority of research and 
development expenditures continues to be concentrated on pharmaceutical and 
diagnostic products.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter and first 
six months 1997 increased 8.7 percent and 11.6 percent, respectively, over 
the comparable prior year periods. The increases reflect additional selling 
and marketing support for new and existing products, primarily for 
pharmaceutical and nutritional products, and due to the acquisition of 
MediSense in the second quarter of 1996.

Other (income) expense, net, includes a net foreign exchange loss of $4.0 
million for the second quarter and gain of $6.8 million for the first six 
months 1997 compared with net foreign exchange losses of $3.8 million and 
$13.2 million for the corresponding prior year periods.

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

Industry segment sales for the second quarter and first six months 1997 and 
the related change from the comparable 1996 periods are shown in the table 
below. The Pharmaceutical and Nutritional Products segment includes a broad 
line of adult and pediatric pharmaceuticals and nutritionals, which are sold 
primarily on the prescription or recommendation of physicians or other health 
care professionals; consumer products; agricultural and chemical products; 
and bulk pharmaceuticals. The Hospital and Laboratory Products segment 
includes diagnostic systems for consumers, blood banks, hospitals, commercial 
laboratories and alternate-care testing sites; intravenous and irrigation 
fluids and related administration equipment; drugs and drug delivery systems; 
anesthetics; critical care products; and other medical specialty products for 
hospitals and alternate-care sites.

Domestic and international sales for the second quarter and first six months 
1997 primarily reflect unit growth. International sales were unfavorably 
affected 7.2 percent by the relatively stronger dollar in the second quarter. 
On a year-to-date basis, international sales were unfavorably affected 6.4 
percent by the relatively stronger U.S. dollar.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AT JUNE 30, 1997
COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 1996     
- -------------------------------------------------

Net cash from operating activities for the first six months 1997 totaled 
$1.364 billion. The Company expects annual cash flow from operating 
activities to continue to approximate or exceed the Company's capital 
expenditures and cash dividends. The company funded the acquisition of Sanofi 
through commercial paper borrowings.

The Company has maintained its favorable bond ratings (AAA by Standard & 
Poor's Corporation and Aa1 by Moody's Investors Service) and continues to 
have readily available financial resources, including unused domestic lines 
of credit of $1.5 billion at June 30, 1997. These lines of credit back up 
domestic commercial paper borrowing arrangements.

During the first six months 1997, the Company continued its program to 
purchase its common shares. The Company purchased and retired 8,027,000 
shares during this period at a cost of $489 million. As of June 30, 1997, an 
additional 7,638,000 shares may be purchased in future periods under 
authorization granted by the Board of Directors in October 1996.

LEGISLATIVE ISSUES

The Company's primary markets are highly competitive and subject to 
substantial government regulation. The Company expects debate to continue at 
both the federal and the state levels over the availability, method of 
delivery, and payment for health care products and services. The Company 
believes that if legislation is enacted, it could have the effect of reducing 
prices, or reducing the rate of price increases for medical products and 
services. International operations are also subject to a significant degree 
of government regulation. It is not possible to predict the extent to which 
the Company or the health care industry in general might be adversely 
affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these 
factors is contained in Item 1, Business, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, 
which is available upon request.

PART II.    OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.       LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         The Company's 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 1997, 
described 5 antitrust suits and 5 investigations (as of April 29, 1997) that 
had been brought in connection with the Company's marketing and sale of 
infant formula products.  The Company has previously reported that it has 
entered into a settlement agreement with plaintiffs involving the 3 cases 
pending in Alabama, Louisiana and Nevada and that the settlement was subject 
to approval by the individual state courts.  On May 30, 1997, the Nevada 
Court gave its final approval.  The Alabama court has not yet given its final 
approval.  The Louisiana court has denied final approval and that case will 
proceed.  An infant formula case is also pending in state court in St. Louis, 
Missouri.  It purports to be a statewide consumer class action. The case 
seeks treble damages, civil penalties, injunctive and other relief.  Another 
infant formula antitrust case is pending in U.S. District Court in 
Massachusetts.  It also purports to be a statewide consumer class action.  An 
agreement has been reached to resolve this case for $1.5 million.  This 
agreement is subject to court approval.  As of June 30, 1997, 4 antitrust 
suits and 5 investigations are pending in connection with the Company's sale 
and marketing of infant formula products.

         The Company's 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 1997, 
described 144 antitrust suits and two investigations (as of March 31, 1997) 
in connection with the Company's pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals.  
Two additional cases have been filed.  One case was filed on March 14, 1997, 
in state court in Prentiss County, Mississippi.  The Company was notified of 
its filing in June, 1997.  The other was filed on June 27, 1997, in state 
court in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.  In addition, the case pending 
in Davidson County, Tennessee was removed to the U.S. District Court.  As of 
July 28, 1997, 122 prescription pharmaceutical pricing antitrust cases were 
pending in federal court, 23 were pending in various state courts, and 1 was 
pending in a District of Columbia court.  The prescription pharmaceutical 
pricing antitrust suits allege that various pharmaceutical manufacturers have 
conspired to fix prices for prescription pharmaceuticals and/or to 
discriminate in pricing to retail pharmacies by providing discounts to 
mail-order pharmacies, institutional pharmacies and HMOs in violation of 
state and federal antitrust laws.  The suits have been brought on behalf of 
individuals and retail pharmacies and name both the Company and certain other 
pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmaceutical wholesalers and at least one 
mail-order pharmacy company as defendants.  The cases seek treble damages, 
civil penalties, injunctive and other relief.  The Company has filed or 
intends to file a response to each of the complaints denying all substantive 
allegations.  The federal cases are pending in the United States District 
Court for the Northern District of Illinois under the Multidistrict 
Litigation Rules as IN RE:  BRAND NAME PRESCRIPTION DRUG ANTITRUST 
LITIGATION, MDL 997.  One of the cases pending in the MDL 997 litigation has 
been certified as a class action on behalf of certain retail pharmacies.  The 
cases pending in California and the District of Columbia have also been 
certified as class actions.  A number of appeals to the Seventh Circuit Court 
of Appeals have been filed arising out of  the MDL 997 litigation.  All 
litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois 
is stayed pending the resolution of these appeals. 

         While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending 
claims, proceedings, and investigations with certainty, management is of the 
opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse 
effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows, or results of 
operations.

                              MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLAN


                                      SECTION 1
                                     INTRODUCTION

    1.1  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSES.  This 1986 ABBOTT LABORATORIES MANAGEMENT
INCENTIVE PLAN (the "Plan") is a successor Plan to the 1961, 1971 and 1981
Management Incentive Plans (the "Predecessor Plans").  This Plan is being
established by ABBOTT LABORATORIES ("Abbott") for the following purposes:

    (a)  To provide greater incentive for participants in the Plan to attain
         and maintain the highest standards of managerial performance by
         rewarding them for services rendered with compensation, in addition to
         their base salaries, in proportion to the success of Abbott and to the
         participants' respective contribution to such success; and

    (b)  To attract and retain in the employ of Abbott and its subsidiaries
         persons of outstanding competence.

    1.2  EFFECTIVE DATE AND FISCAL YEAR.  The Plan shall be effective as of
January 1, 1986.  The term "fiscal year," as used in this Plan, means the fiscal
period from time to time employed by Abbott for the purpose of reporting
earnings to shareholders.

    1.3  ADMINISTRATION.  The Plan will be administered by the Compensation
Committee (the "Committee") appointed by the Board of Directors of Abbott.

                                      SECTION 2
                            ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION

    2.1  PERSONS ELIGIBLE FOR PARTICIPATION.  Participation in the Plan will be
limited to those Officers and managerial employees of Abbott and its
subsidiaries who, from time to time, shall be selected as participants by the
Committee.
<PAGE>
    2.2  PARTICIPANTS.  The term "participant," as used in the Plan, shall
include both active participants and inactive participants.

    2.3  ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS.  For each fiscal year, there shall be a group 
of active participants which, except as provided below, shall not exceed 
forty-five persons and shall consist of those persons eligible for 
participation who shall have been designated as active participants and 
notified of that fact by the Committee at any time before or during the 
fiscal year.  If, as a result of the growth of Abbott and its subsidiaries or 
changes in Abbott's organization, the Board of Directors deems it 
appropriate, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion, from time to 
time, increase the number of persons who may be designated as active 
participants for any fiscal year beyond the limit of forty-five persons 
provided for above.  Selection as an active participant for any fiscal year 
shall not confer upon any person a right to be an active participant in any 
subsequent fiscal year, nor shall it confer upon him the right to receive any 
allocation under the Plan, other than amounts allocated to him by the 
Committee pursuant to the Plan, and all such allocations shall be subject to 
all of the terms and conditions of the Plan.

     2.4  INACTIVE PARTICIPANTS.  Inactive participants shall consist of 
those persons, including beneficiaries of deceased participants, if any, for 
whom an allocation shall have been made for a prior fiscal year under this 
Plan or a Predecessor Plan, the payment of which was deferred and remains 
unpaid.  Status as an inactive participant shall not preclude a person from 
also being an active participant during any fiscal year.

                                      SECTION 3
                             MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLAN FUND

    3.1  BASE FOR MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLAN FUND.  The "base earnings" for
determining whether any portion of consolidated net income for any fiscal year
may be allocated to the Management Incentive Plan Fund for such year shall be
that amount of consolidated net income (as defined in subsection 3.2) which is
equal to 15 percent of the 
                                       2
<PAGE>

Abbott Common Shareholder's Equity for such fiscal year.  For this purpose, 
"Abbott Common Shareholders' Equity" for any fiscal year shall mean the 
Shareholders' Investment, as reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of 
Abbott as of the close of the next preceding fiscal year, plus or minus such 
adjustments thereof as may be determined by the Committee in order to 
reflect:

    (a)  The existence, issuance, sale, exchange, conversion or retirement 
         of any securities, other than common shares, of Abbott (whether 
         involving preferred stock, debt, convertible preferred stock or 
         convertible debt securities); and

    (b)  The issuance or retirement of any common shares or any changes in
         accounting methods or period adopted by Abbott since the close of such
         next preceding fiscal year.

Any adjustments to be made in accordance with (a) and (b) above in determining
Abbott Common Shareholders' Equity for any fiscal year shall be determined by
the Committee after consultation with Abbott's independent auditors, and any
determination made by the Committee after such consultation shall be conclusive
upon all persons.

    3.2  CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME.  For the purposes of this Plan, for any
fiscal year or period, the "consolidated net income" shall be the consolidated
net income of Abbott and its subsidiaries, prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, after provision for any
interest accrued with respect to such period on account of deferred payments
under this Plan or a Predecessor Plan, but before allowances for any amount to
be allocated to the Management Incentive Plan Fund, both net of applicable
income taxes, and after such adjustments for the following, as may be determined
by the Committee after consultation with Abbott's independent auditors (all net
of applicable income taxes):

    (a)  The exclusion of any charges for amortization of goodwill arising out
         of acquisitions made for securities which, as a result of adjustments
         made in determining Abbott Common Shareholders' Equity pursuant to
         subsection 3.1, are treated as common share equivalents; and
                                       3
<PAGE>
    (b)  The exclusion of any interest on debt securities which are convertible
         into common shares of Abbott and which shall have been considered as
         common share equivalents in determining Abbott Common Shareholders'
         Equity pursuant to subsection 3.1 hereof; and

    (c)  The deduction of any dividend requirement for preferred shares which
         has not been considered as common share equivalents in determining
         Common Shareholders' Equity pursuant to subsection 3.1 hereof.

In the sole discretion of the Committee there shall also be excluded in the
calculation of "consolidated net income" unusual gains and losses and the tax
effects thereof, changes in generally accepted accounting principles and the tax
effects thereof and extraordinary gains and losses.

    3.3  DETERMINATION OF MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLAN AMOUNT FOR ANY YEAR.   For
each fiscal year that consolidated net income exceeds base earnings, and as soon
as practicable after ascertainment of that fact, the Committee shall determine a
tentative amount as the Management Incentive Plan Amount for that year, which
tentative amount shall not exceed the lesser of:

    (a)  an amount which, when treated as an expense currently deductible 
         for income tax purposes in such year, would cause a 5 percent 
         reduction in such year's excess of consolidated net income over 
         the base earnings for such year; and

    (b)  an amount which, when treated as an expense currently deductible 
         for income tax purposes in such year, would cause a 1-1/2 percent 
         reduction in such year's consolidated net income; and

    (c)  an amount which equals 200 percent of the aggregate base salaries 
         of all active participants for such year.

For purposes of the Plan "base salary" means the amount of salary paid to each
active participant by Abbott and its subsidiaries for such year plus the
includible portion (as described below) of any "Eligible Restricted Stock
Award," as defined in Section 5-2 of the Abbott Laboratories Supplemental
Pension Plan and does not include bonuses, other awards or any other
compensation of any kind.  The includible portion of a participant's Eligible
Restricted Stock Award shall be the portion of the participant's Eligible
Restricted
                                       4
<PAGE>
Stock Award that is included in the participant's final earnings under the 
Abbott Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan for such year. Following 
determination of such tentative Management Incentive Plan Amount, the 
Committee shall report in writing the amount of such tentative amount to the 
Board of Directors.  At the meeting of the Board of Directors coincident with 
or next following receipt by it of the Committee's determination, the Board 
of Directors shall have the power to approve or reduce, but not to increase, 
the tentative amount reported to it by the Committee.  The amount approved by 
the Board of Directors shall be the Management Incentive Plan Amount for such 
year.

     3.4  THE MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLAN FUND. The Management Incentive Plan 
Fund at any time shall consist of an amount equal to the aggregate of the 
Management Incentive Plan Amounts established pursuant to subsection 3.3 of 
this Plan for all fiscal years during which this Plan shall have been 
operative, plus the amounts established as Management Incentive Plan Amounts 
for any prior fiscal year pursuant to a Predecessor Plan, reduced by an 
amount equal to the aggregate of the amounts of awards which shall have been 
allocated to participants in accordance with this Plan or a Predecessor Plan, 
and awards, or any other compensation of any kind. Following determination 
of such tentative Management Incentive Plan Amount, the Committee shall 
report in writing the amount of such tentative amount to the Board of 
Directors.  At the meeting of the Board of Directors coincident with or next 
following receipt by it of the Committee's determination, the Board of 
Directors shall have the power to approve or reduce, but not to increase, the 
tentative amount reported to it by the Committee. The amount approved by the 
Board of Directors shall be the Management Incentive Plan Amount for such 
year.

                       ALLOCATION OF MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE FUND
                                           
     4.1  ANNUAL ALLOCATION OF MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE FUND. As soon as 
practicable after the close of each fiscal year, part or all of the amount 
then in the Management Incentive Plan Fund (including the Management 
Incentive Plan Amount for such fiscal year) will be allocated by the 
Committee among active participants in the Plan for such fiscal year, having 
due regard for the purposes for which the Plan was established, in the 
following manner and order:

    (a)  First, if the Chairman of the Board of Abbott shall be an active
         participant for such year, the members of the Committee, other than
         the Chairman of the Board, shall determine the amount, if any, to be
         allocated to the Chairman of the Board from such Fund for such year;
         and

    (b)  Next, all or a part of the balance of such Fund may be allocated among
         the active participants (other than the Chairman of the Board) for
         such year, in such amounts and proportions as the Committee shall
         determine

provided, however, that the amount allocated to any active participant for any
year shall not exceed 200 percent of such participant's base salary for that
year.

    4.2  COMMITTEE'S DISCRETION IN ALLOCATIONS.  In making any allocations in
accordance with subsection 4.1 for any year, the discretion of the Committee
shall be absolute, and no active participants for any year, by reason of their
designation as such, shall be entitled to any particular amounts or any amount
whatsoever.

                                      SECTION 5
                     PAYMENT OF AMOUNTS ALLOCATED TO PARTICIPANTS

    5.1  TIME OF PAYMENT.  For fiscal years beginning after December 31, 1988,
a participant shall direct the payment or deferral of an allocation made to him
pursuant to subsection 4.1 (subject to such conditions relating to the right of
the participant to receive Payment of such amount as established by the
Committee) by one or more of the following methods:
                                       6
<PAGE>
    (a)  current payment in cash to the participant;

    (b)  current payment of a portion of the allocation in cash for the
         participant directly to a "Grantor Trust" established by the
         participant, provided such trust is in a form which the Committee
         determines is substantially similar to the trust attached to this Plan
         as Exhibit A; and current payment of the balance of the allocation in
         cash directly to the participant, provided that the payment made
         directly to the participant shall approximate the aggregate federal,
         state and local individual income taxes (determined in accordance with
         subsection 6.7) attributable to the allocation paid pursuant to this
         paragraph (b); or

    (c)  deferral of payment until such time and in such manner as determined
         in accordance with subsection 5.11.

A participant shall make the preceding direction within 30 days of the date he
is notified of his eligibility to participate in the Plan.  A participant may
change such direction with respect to any future allocation, provided that the
change is made prior to the beginning of the fiscal year to which such
allocation relates.  Payment of a participant's allocation for the 1988 fiscal
year and of any allocations deferred under the Plan prior to such year shall be
made in accordance with the provisions of either or both of paragraphs (a) and
(b) above.  The Committee shall establish and maintain a Trust Account in
accordance with subsection 5.2 and for purposes of subsection 5.4, shall treat
such payment as if it were an allocation made for that fiscal year.

    5.2  SEPARATE ACCOUNTS.  The Committee will maintain two separate Accounts,
a "Deferred Account" and a "Trust Account," in the name of each participant. 
The Deferred Account shall be comprised of any allocations the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to subsection 5.1(c) and any adjustments made pursuant to
subsection 5.3.  The Trust Account shall be comprised of any allocations paid in
cash to a participant (including amounts paid to a participant's Grantor Trust)
pursuant to subsection 5.1(b) and any adjustments made pursuant to subsection
5.4.

    5.3  ADJUSTMENT OF DEFERRED ACCOUNTS.  As of the end of each fiscal year,
the Committee shall adjust each participant's Deferred Account as follows:
                                       7
<PAGE>
    (a)  FIRST, charge an amount equal to any payments made to the participant
         during that year pursuant to subsections 5.11 or 5.12;

    (b)  NEXT, credit an amount equal to the allocation for that year that is
         deferred pursuant to subsection 5.1(c); and

    (c)  FINALLY, credit an amount equal to the Interest Accrual earned for
         that year pursuant to subsection 5.5.

    5.4  ADJUSTMENT OF TRUST ACCOUNTS.  As of the end of each fiscal year, the
Committee shall adjust each participant's Trust Account as follows:

    (a)  FIRST, charge an amount equal to the product of:  (i) any payments
         made to the participant during that year from the participant's
         Grantor Trust (other than distributions of trust earnings in excess of
         the Net Interest Accrual authorized by the administrator of the trust
         to provide for the Tax Gross Up under subsection 6.6); multiplied by
         (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the balance in the
         participant's Trust Account as of the end of the prior fiscal year and
         the denominator of which is the balance of the participant's Grantor
         Trust (as determined by the administrator of the trust) as of that
         same date;

    (b)  NEXT, credit an amount equal to the allocation for that year that is
         paid to the Participant (including the amount paid to the
         participant's Grantor Trust) pursuant to subsection 5.l(b); and

    (c)  FINALLY, credit an amount equal to the Interest Accrual earned for
         that Year pursuant to subsection 5.5.

    5.5  INTEREST ACCRUALS ON ACCOUNTS.  As of the end of each fiscal year, a
participant's Deferred Account and Trust Account shall be credited with interest
equal to:  (a) the average of the prime rates of interest charged by the two
largest banks located in the City of Chicago on loans made by them as of January
1 and the end of each month of the fiscal year; plus (b) two hundred twenty-five
(225) basis points.  Such interest shall be credited on the conditions
established by the Committee, provided that any allocation of an award from the
Management Incentive Plan Fund shall be considered to have been made and
credited to a participant's Deferred Account and Trust Account as of the first
day of the fiscal year in which such award is made regardless of the date upon
which the Committee actually makes the determination to award such allocation.
                                       8
<PAGE>
    5.6  GUARANTEED RATE PAYMENTS.  In addition to any allocation made to a
participant for any fiscal year pursuant to subsection 4.1 which is paid or
deferred pursuant to subsection 5.1, Abbott shall also make a payment to a
participant's Grantor Trust (a "Guaranteed Rate Payment") for any year in which
the net earnings of such trust do not equal or exceed the participant's Net
Interest Accrual for that year.  A participant's "Net Interest Accrual" for a
year is an amount equal to: (a) the Interest Accrual credited to the
participant's Trust Account for that year; less (b) the product of (i) the
amount of such Interest Accrual, multiplied by (ii) the aggregate of the
federal, state and local individual income tax rates (determined in accordance
with subsection 6.7).  The Guaranteed Rate Payment shall equal the difference
between the participant's Net Interest Accrual and the net earnings of the
participant's Grantor Trust for the year, and shall be paid within 90 days of
the end of the fiscal year.

    5.7  DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARIES.  Subject to the conditions and
limitations set forth below, each participant, and after a participant's death,
each primary beneficiary designated by a participant in accordance with the
provisions of this subsection 5.7, shall have the right from time to time to
designate a primary beneficiary or beneficiaries and, successive or contingent
beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive unpaid amounts from the participant's
Deferred Account under the Plan and the Predecessor Plans.  Beneficiaries may be
a natural person or persons or a fiduciary, such as a trustee of a trust or the
legal representative of an estate.  Any such designation shall take effect upon
the death of the participant or such beneficiary, as the case may be, or in the
case of any fiduciary beneficiary, upon the termination of all of its duties
(other than the duty to dispose of the right to receive amounts remaining to be
paid under the Plan or a Predecessor Plan).  The conditions and limitations
relating to the designation of beneficiaries are as follows:
                                       9
<PAGE>
    (a)  A nonfiduciary beneficiary shall have the right to designate a further
         beneficiary or beneficiaries only if the original participant or the
         next preceding primary beneficiary, as the case may be, shall have
         expressly so provided in writing; and

    (b)  A fiduciary beneficiary shall designate as a further beneficiary or
         beneficiaries only those persons or other fiduciaries who are entitled
         to receive the amounts payable from the participant's account under
         the trust or estate of which it is a fiduciary.

Any beneficiary designation or grant of any power to any beneficiary under this
subsection may be exercised only by an instrument in writing, executed by the
person making the designation or granting such power and filed with the
Secretary of Abbott during such person's lifetime or prior to the termination of
a fiduciary's duties.  If a deceased participant or a deceased nonfiduciary
beneficiary who had the right to designate a beneficiary as provided above dies
without having designated a further beneficiary, or if no beneficiary designated
as provided above is living or qualified and acting, the Committee, in its
discretion, may direct distribution of the amount remaining from time to time to
either:

    (i)  any one or more or all of the next of kin (including the surviving
         spouse) of the participant or the deceased beneficiary, as the case
         may be, and in such proportions as the Committee determines; or

    (ii) the legal representative of the estate of the deceased participant or
         deceased beneficiary as the case may be.

    5.8  STATUS OF BENEFICIARIES.  Following a participant's death, the
participant's beneficiary or beneficiaries will be considered and treated as an
inactive participant for all purposes of this Plan.

    5.9  NON-ASSIGNABILITY AND FACILITY OF PAYMENT.  Amounts payable to
participants and their beneficiaries under the Plan are not in any way subject
to their debts and other obligations, and may not be voluntarily or
involuntarily sold, transferred or assigned; provided that the preceding
provisions of this section shall not be construed as restricting in any way a
designation right granted to a beneficiary pursuant to the terms of subsection
5.7.  When a participant or the beneficiary of a participant is under legal
disability, or in the
                                       10
<PAGE>
Committee's opinion is in any way incapacitated so as to be unable to manage 
his or her financial affairs, the Committee may direct that payments shall be 
made to the participant's or beneficiary's legal representative, or to a 
relative or friend of the participant or beneficiary for the benefit of the 
participant or beneficiary, or the Committee may direct the payment or 
distribution for the benefit of the participant or beneficiary in any manner 
that the Committee determines.

     5.10 PAYER OF AMOUNTS ALLOCATED TO PARTICIPANTS.  Any amount allocated 
to a participant in the Plan and any interest credited thereto will be paid 
by the employer (or such employer's successor) by whom the participant was 
employed during the fiscal year for which any amount was allocated, and for 
that purpose, if a participant shall have been employed by two or more 
employers during any fiscal year the amount allocated under this Plan for 
that year shall be an obligation of each of the respective employers in 
proportion to the respective amounts of base salary paid by each of them in 
that fiscal year.

     5.11 MANNER OF PAYMENT.  Subject to subsections 5.12, a participant 
shall elect the timing and manner of payment of his Deferred Account at the 
time of his deferral election under subsection 5.l.  The participant may 
select a payment method from among alternative payment methods established by 
the Committee.

     5.12 PAYMENT UPON TERMINATION FOLLOWING CHANGE IN CONTROL. 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Plan or the Predecessor Plans, 
or the provisions of any award made under this Plan or the Predecessor Plans, 
if employment of any participant with Abbott and its subsidiaries should 
terminate for any reason within five (5) years after the date of a Change in 
Control, the aggregate unpaid balance of all awards previously made to such 
participant under this Plan and all Predecessor Plans, plus any unpaid 
interest credited thereon, shall be paid to the participant in a lump sum 
within thirty (30) days following the date of such termination.
                                       11
<PAGE>

     5.13 CHANGE IN CONTROL.  A "Change in Control" shall be deemed to have 
occurred on the earliest of the following dates:

          (i) The date any entity or person (including a "group" as defined in
              Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
              "Exchange Act")) shall have become the beneficial owner of, or
              shall have obtained voting control over thirty percent (30%) or
              more of the outstanding common shares of Abbott;

         (ii) The date the shareholders of Abbott approve a definitive
              agreement (A) to merge or consolidate Abbott with or into another
              corporation, in which Abbott is not the continuing or surviving
              corporation or pursuant to which any common shares of Abbott
              would be converted into cash, securities or other property of
              another corporation, other than a merger of Abbott in which
              holders of common shares immediately prior to the merger have the
              same proportionate ownership of common stock of the surviving
              corporation immediately after the merger as immediately before,
              or (B) to sell or otherwise dispose of substantially all the
              assets of Abbott; or

        (iii) The date there shall have been a change in a majority of the
              Board of Directors of Abbott within a twelve (12) month
              period unless the nomination for election by Abbott's
              shareholders of each new director was approved by the vote
              of two-thirds of the directors then still in office who were
              in office at the beginning of the twelve (12) month period.

    5.14 PROHIBITION AGAINST AMENDMENT.  The provisions of subsections 5.12,
5.13 and this subsection 5.14 may not be amended or deleted, nor superseded by
any other provision of this Plan, during the period beginning on the date of a
Change in Control and ending on the date five (5) years following such Change in
Control.

                                    MISCELLANEOUS

    6.1  RULES.  The Committee may establish such rules and regulations as it
may consider necessary or desirable for the effective and efficient
administration of the Plan.

    6.2  MANNER OF ACTION BY COMMITTEE.  A majority of the members of the
Committee qualified to act on any particular question may act by meeting or by
writing signed without meeting, and may execute any instrument or document
required or delegate to one of its members authority to sign.  The Committee
from time to time may delegate
                                       12
<PAGE>
the performance of certain ministerial functions in connection with the Plan, 
such as the keeping of records, to such person or persons as the Committee 
may select. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, the costs of 
administration of the Plan will be paid by Abbott.  Any notice required to be 
given to, or any document required to be filed with the Committee, will be 
properly given or filed if mailed or delivered in writing to the Secretary of 
Abbott.

    6.3  RELIANCE UPON ADVICE.  The Board of Directors and the Committee may
rely upon any information or advice furnished to it by any Officer of Abbott or
by Abbott's independent auditors, or other consultants, and shall be fully
protected in relying upon such information or advice.  No member of the Board of
Directors or the Committee shall be liable for any act or failure to act on
their part, excepting only any acts done or omitted to be done in bad faith, nor
shall they be liable for any act or failure to act of any other member.

    6.4  TAXES.  Any employer shall be entitled, if necessary or desirable, to
pay, or withhold the amount of any federal, state or local tax, attributable to
any amounts payable by it under the Plan after giving the person entitled to
receive such amount notice as far in advance as practicable, and may defer
making payment of any amount with respect to which any such tax question may be
pending unless and until indemnified to its satisfaction.

    6.5  RIGHTS OF PARTICIPANTS.  Employment rights of participants with Abbott
and its subsidiaries shall not be enlarged or affected by reason of
establishment of or inclusion as a participant in the Plan.  Nothing contained
in the Plan shall require Abbott or any subsidiary to segregate or earmark any
assets, funds or property for the purpose of payment of any amounts which may
have been deferred.  The Deferred and Trust Accounts established pursuant to
subsection 5.2 are for the convenience of the administration of the
                                       13
<PAGE>
Plan and no trust relationship with respect to such Accounts is intended or 
should be implied.  Participant's rights shall be limited to payment to them 
at the time or times and in such amounts as are contemplated by the Plan.  
Any decision made by the Board of Directors or the Committee, which is within 
the sole and uncontrolled discretion of either, shall be conclusive and 
binding upon the other and upon all other persons whomsoever.

    6.6  TAX GROSS UP.  In addition to the allocations provided under
subsection 4.1, each participant (or, if the participant is deceased, the
beneficiary designated under the participant's Grantor Trust) shall be entitled
to a Tax Gross Up payment for each year there is a balance in his or her Trust
Account.  The "Tax Gross Up" shall approximate: (a) the amount necessary to
compensate the participant (or beneficiary) for the net increase in the
participant's (or beneficiary's) federal, state and local income taxes as a
result of the inclusion in his or her taxable income of the income of the
participant's Grantor Trust and any Guaranteed Rate Payment for that year; less
(b) any distribution to the participant (or beneficiary) of his or her Grantor
Trust's net earnings for that year; plus (c) an amount necessary to compensate
the participant (or beneficiary) for the net increase in the taxes described in
(a) above as a result of the inclusion in his or her taxable income of any
payment made pursuant to this subsection 6.6.  Payment of the Tax Gross Up shall
be made by the employers (in such proportions as Abbott shall designate)
directly from their general corporate assets.

    6.7   INCOME TAX ASSUMPTIONS.  For purposes of Sections 5 and 6, a
participant's federal income tax rate shall be deemed to be the highest marginal
rate of federal income individual tax in effect in the calendar year in which a
calculation under those Sections is to be made, and state and local tax rates
shall be deemed to be the highest marginal rates of individual income tax in
effect in the state and locality of the participant's residence on the date such
a calculation is made, net of any federal tax benefits.
                                       14
<PAGE>
    6.8  PAYMENT OF PRIOR DEFERRALS.  Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Plan, the Committee, in its absolute discretion, may direct that all or a
portion of the balance in a participant's Deferred Account be paid in accordance
with the provisions of subsection 5.1(b).  In such event, the Committee shall
establish and maintain a Trust Account in accordance with subsection 5.2 and,
for purposes of subsection 5.4, shall treat such payment as if it were an
allocation made for that fiscal year.

                                      SECTION 7
                         AMENDMENT, TERMINATION AND CHANGE OF
                           CONDITIONS RELATING TO PAYMENTS

    7.1  AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.  The Plan will be effective from its
effective date until terminated by the Board of Directors.  During the fifth
year after the Plan's effective date and during every fifth year thereafter, the
Committee may recommend to the Board of Directors whether the Plan should be
amended or terminated.  The Board of Directors reserves the right to amend the
Plan from time to time and to terminate the Plan at any time, except that no
such amendment or any termination of the Plan shall reduce any fixed or
contingent obligations which shall have arisen under the Plan prior to the date
of such amendment or termination, or change the terms and conditions of payment
of any allocation theretofore made without the consent of the participant
concerned.

    7.2  CHANGE OF CONDITIONS RELATING TO PAYMENTS.  Following the
establishment by the Committee of any conditions relating to the payment of any
amount allocated to a participant for any fiscal year and any interest credited
thereon (including the time of payment or the time of commencement of payment
and any period over which payment shall be made), neither the Committee nor the
participant concerned, acting unilaterally, shall have the power to change the
conditions originally established by the Committee.  
                                       15
<PAGE>
However, in order to effectuate the purposes of the Plan, any conditions
initially established by the Committee may be changed thereafter by mutual
agreement of the Committee and the participant concerned.

                         IRREVOCABLE GRANTOR TRUST AGREEMENT


    THIS AGREEMENT, made this__________day of_________________, 1991, by and 
between _____________________of_______________, Illinois (the "grantor"), and 
The Northern Trust Company located at Chicago, Illinois, as trustee (the 
"trustee"),

                                   WITNESSETH THAT:

    WHEREAS, the grantor desires to establish and maintain a trust to hold
certain benefits received by the grantor under the 1986 Abbott Laboratories
Management Incentive Plan, as it may be amended from time to time;

    NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS AGREED as follows:

                                      ARTICLE I

                                     INTRODUCTION

    I-1.  NAME.  This agreement and the trust hereby evidenced (the "trust")
may be referred to as the "________________________ 1991 Grantor Trust".

    I-2.  THE TRUST FUND The "trust fund" as at any date means all property
then held by the trustee under this agreement.

    I-3.  STATUS OF THE TRUST.  The trust shall be irrevocable.  The trust is
intended to constitute a grantor trust under Sections 671-678 of the Internal
Revenue Code, as amended, and shall be construed accordingly.

    I-4.  THE ADMINISTRATOR.  Abbott Laboratories ("Abbott") shall act as the
"administrator" of the trust, and as such shall have certain powers, rights and
duties under this agreement as described below.  Abbott will certify to the
trustee from time to time the person or persons authorized to act on behalf of
Abbott as the administrator.  The trustee may rely on the latest certificate
received without further inquiry or verification.

    I-5.  ACCEPTANCE.  The trustee accepts the duties and obligations of the
"trustee" hereunder, agrees to accept funds delivered to it by the grantor or
the administrator, and agrees to hold such funds (and any proceeds from the
investment of such funds) in trust in accordance with this agreement.

                                      ARTICLE II
                            DISTRIBUTION OF THE TRUST FUND

    II-1.  SEPARATE ACCOUNTS.  The administrator shall maintain two separate
accounts under the trust, a "rollout account" and a "deferred account." Funds
delivered to the trustee shall be allocated between the accounts by the trustee
as directed by the administrator.  As of the end of each calendar year, the
administrator shall charge each account with all distributions made from such
account during that year; and credit each account with its share of income and
realized gains and charge each account with its share of expenses and
<PAGE>
realized losses for the year.  The trustee shall not be required to make any 
separate investment of the trust fund for the accounts, and may administer 
and invest all funds delivered to it under the trust as one trust fund.

    II-2.  DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE ROLLOUT ACCOUNT PRIOR TO THE GRANTOR'S DEATH. 
The trustee shall distribute principal and accumulated income credited to the
rollout account to the grantor, if then living, at such times and in such
amounts as the administrator shall direct.

    II-3.  DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE DEFERRED ACCOUNT PRIOR TO THE GRANTOR'S
DEATH.  Principal and accumulated income credited to the deferred account shall
not be distributed from the trust prior to the grantor's retirement or other
termination of employment with Abbott or a subsidiary of Abbott (the grantor's
"settlement date"); provided that, each year the administrator may direct the
trustee to distribute to the grantor a portion of the income of the deferred
account for that year, with the balance of such income to be accumulated in that
account.  The administrator shall inform the trustee of the grantor's settlement
date.  Thereafter, the trustee shall distribute the amounts from time to time
credited to the deferred account to the grantor, if then living, in a series of
annual installments, with the amount of each installment computed by one of the
following methods:

    (a)  The amount of each installment shall be equal to the sum of: (i) the
         amount credited to the deferred account as of the end of the year in
         which the grantor's settlement date occurs, divided by the number of
         years over which installments are to be distributed; plus (ii) the net
         earnings credited to the deferred account for the preceding year
         (excluding the year in which the grantor's settlement date occurs).

    (b)  The amount of each installment shall be determined by dividing the
         amount credited to the deferred account as of the end of the preceding
         year by the difference between (i) the total number of years over
         which installments are to be distributed, and (ii) the number of
         annual installment distributions previously made from the deferred
         account.

    (c)  Each installment (after the first installment) shall be approximately
         equal, with the amount comprised of the sum of: (i) the amount of the
         first installment, plus interest thereon at the rate determined under
         the 1986 Abbott Laboratories Management Incentive Plan, compounded
         annually; and (ii) the net earnings credited to the deferred account
         for the preceding year.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the final installment distribution made to the
grantor under this paragraph II-3 shall equal the total principal and
accumulated income then held in the trust fund.  The grantor, by writing filed
with the trustee and the administrator on or before the end of the calendar year
in which the grantor's settlement date occurs (or the end of the calendar year
in which this trust is established, if the grantor's settlement date has already
occurred), may select both the period (which may not be less than ten years from
the end of the calendar year in which the grantor's settlement date occurred)
over which the installment distributions are to be made and the method of
computing the amount of each installment.  In the absence of such a written
direction by the grantor, installment distributions shall be made over a period
of ten years, and the amount of each installment
                                       2
<PAGE>
shall be computed by using the method described in subparagraph (a) next above.
Installment distributions under this Paragraph II-3 shall be made as of 
January 1 of each year, beginning with the calendar year following the year 
in which the grantor's settlement date occurs.  The administrator shall 
inform the trustee of the amount of each installment distribution under this 
paragraph II-3, and the trustee shall be fully protected in relying on such 
information received from the administrator.

    II-4.  DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE TRUST FUND AFTER THE GRANTOR'S DEATH.  The
grantor, from time to time may name any person or persons (who may be named
contingently or successively and who may be natural persons or fiduciaries) to
whom the principal of the trust fund and all accrued or undistributed income
thereof shall be distributed in a lump sum or, if the beneficiary is the
grantor's spouse, in installments, as directed by the grantor, upon the
grantor's death.  If the grantor directs an installment method of distribution,
any amounts remaining at the death of the spouse beneficiary shall be
distributed in a lump sum.  Each designation shall revoke all prior
designations, shall be in writing and shall be effective only when filed by the
grantor with the administrator during the grantor's lifetime.  If the grantor
fails to direct a method of distribution, the distribution shall be made in a
lump sum.  If the grantor fails to designate a beneficiary as provided above,
then on the grantor's death, the trustee shall distribute the balance of the
trust fund in a lump sum to the executor or administrator of the grantor's
estate.

    II-5.  FACILITY OF PAYMENT.  When a person entitled to a distribution
hereunder is under legal disability, or, in the trustee's opinion, is in any way
incapacitated so as to be unable to manage his or her financial affairs, the
trustee may make such distribution to such person's legal representative, or to
a relative or friend of such person for such person's benefit.  Any distribution
made in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be a full and complete
discharge of any liability for such distribution hereunder.

    II-6.  PERPETUITIES.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
agreement, on the day next preceding the end of 21 years after the death of the
last to die of the grantor and the grantor's descendants living on the date of
this instrument, the trustee shall immediately distribute any remaining balance
in the trust to the beneficiaries then entitled to distributions hereunder.

                                     ARTICLE III

    (m)  To deal without restriction with the legal representative of the
         grantor's estate or the trustee or other legal representative of any
         trust created by the grantor or a trust or estate in which a

grantor.  The administrator may remove a trustee by written notice to the
trustee and the grantor.

    V-3.  DUTIES OF RESIGNING OR REMOVED TRUSTEE AND OF SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE.  A
trustee that resigns or is removed shall furnish promptly to the administrator
and the successor trustee an account of its administration of the trust from the

administrator, a successor trustee may accept the account furnished and the
property delivered by a predecessor trustee without incurring any liability for
so doing, and such acceptance will be complete discharge to the predecessor
trustee.

    NOTE:     For the purpose of calculating this ratio, (i) earnings have 
              been calculated by adjusting net earnings for taxes on 
              earnings; interest expense; capitalized interest cost, net of 
              amortization; minority interest; and the portion of rentals 
              representative of the interest factor, (ii) the Company 
              considers one-third of rental expense to be the amount 
              representing return on capital, and (iii) fixed charges 
              comprise total interest expense, including capitalized interest 
              and such portion of rentals.
