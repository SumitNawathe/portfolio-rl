              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                               SEPTEMBER 30, 1994

                                   (UNAUDITED)

NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PREPARATION:

The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and footnote
disclosures normally included in audited financial statements.  However, in the
opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments)
necessary to present fairly the financial position, cash flows, and results of
operations have been made.  It is suggested that these statements be read in
conjunction with the financial statements included in the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993.


NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE:

Earnings per common share amounts are computed by using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding.  These shares averaged 814,480,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 1994 and 830,898,000 for the same period
in 1993.


NOTE 3 - TAXES ON EARNINGS:

Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective tax rates.  The
effective tax rates are less than the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate
principally due to tax incentive grants related to subsidiaries operating in
Puerto Rico and Ireland.  The increase in the effective tax rate from 28 percent
in 1993 to 30 percent in 1994 is due primarily to the increase in the statutory
U.S. Federal income tax rate and the reduction in the tax incentive grants for
operations in Puerto Rico.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 1994
(Unaudited), Continued


NOTE 4 - LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:

The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings including
numerous antitrust suits and investigations in connection with the sale and
marketing of infant formula and the pricing of prescription pharmaceutical
products.

The Company is also involved in numerous product liability cases, many of which
allege injuries to the offspring of women who ingested a synthetic estrogen
(DES) during pregnancy.  In addition, the Company has been identified as a
potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of
locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under Federal remediation laws
and is voluntarily investigating potential contamination at a number of
Company-owned locations.

The matters above are discussed more fully in Item 1, Business - Environmental
Matters, and Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, which
is available upon request, and in Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings, in this
Form.

While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending claims,
proceedings, investigations and remediation activities with certainty,
management is of the opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows, or
results of operations.


NOTE 5 - OTHER SIGNIFICANT EVENTS:

In June 1992, the Company voluntarily withdrew from the worldwide market its
quinolone anti-infective, temafloxacin, and recorded a charge for costs
associated with this withdrawal.  In the second quarter 1993, the Company
resolved various contingencies relative to the temafloxacin withdrawal and
recorded a credit for these items.

FINANCIAL REVIEW


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - THIRD QUARTER AND FIRST NINE MONTHS 1994 COMPARED WITH
SAME PERIODS IN 1993

Worldwide sales for the third quarter and first nine months increased
9.4 percent and 8.0 percent, respectively, over the comparable 1993 periods.
Net earnings increased 11.1 percent and 8.6 percent, respectively, in the third
quarter and first nine months 1994.  Earnings per share increased 13.2 percent
and 10.7 percent, respectively, in the third quarter and first nine months 1994.

Gross profit margin (sales less cost of products sold, including freight and
distribution expenses) of 56.1 percent for the first nine months of 1994 was up
from 55.7 percent one year ago primarily due to product mix.  Gross margin of
54.9 percent for the third quarter 1994 was down from 55.5 percent in the third
quarter of 1993.  This decrease was due to timing of certain expenses incurred
in the third quarter of 1994 which were incurred in earlier quarters in 1993,
partially offset by product mix.

Research and development expenses were $239.4 million and $711.2 million for the
third quarter and first nine months 1994, respectively.  This represented
10.6 percent and 10.7 percent of net sales, compared to 10.9 percent and
10.3 percent in 1993.  The majority of research and development expenditures
continues to be concentrated on pharmaceutical and diagnostic products.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased
9.0 percent over the prior year and decreased 0.8 percent for the nine months
ended September 30.  The first nine month decrease reflects the settlement in
1993 of certain claims and legal proceedings in connection with the sale and
marketing of infant formula products.  In the second quarter of 1993, the
Company recorded a pre-tax charge to earnings of approximately $104 million in
connection with these settlements.

During the second quarter of 1993, the Company resolved various contingencies
relative to the temafloxacin withdrawal.  The Company recorded a pre-tax credit
to earnings of $70 million for these items.

Other (income) expense, net, includes net foreign exchange losses of
$1.9 million and $29.5 million, respectively, for the third quarter and first
nine months 1994 compared with net foreign exchange losses of $11.8 million and
$31.0 million for the corresponding prior year periods.  Also included in the
first nine months of 1993 is the gain on the sale of the Company's peritoneal
dialysis product line.

The effective income tax rate increased from 28 percent in 1993 to 30 percent in
1994 due primarily to the increase in the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate
and the reduction in tax incentive grants for Puerto Rico operations.

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

Industry segment sales for the third quarter and first nine months 1994 and the
related change from the comparable 1993 periods are shown in the table below.
The Pharmaceutical and Nutritional Products segment includes a broad line of
adult and pediatric pharmaceuticals and nutritionals, which are sold primarily
on the prescription or recommendation of physicians or other health care
professionals; consumer products; agricultural and chemical products; and bulk
pharmaceuticals.  The Hospital and Laboratory Products segment includes
diagnostic systems for blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories and
alternate-care testing sites; intravenous and irrigation fluids and related
administration equipment; drugs and drug delivery systems; anesthetics; critical
care products; and other medical specialty products for hospitals and
alternate-care sites.

Domestic and international sales for the third quarter and first nine months
1994 primarily reflect unit growth. International sales were favorably affected
1.8 percent by the relatively weaker dollar in the third quarter.  On a year-to-
date basis, international sales were adversely affected 1.8 percent due to the
relatively stronger U.S. dollar.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AT SEPTEMBER 30, 1994
COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 1993


Net cash from operating activities for the first nine months 1994 totaled
$1.620 billion.  The Company expects annual cash flow from operating activities
to continue to approximate or exceed the Company's capital expenditures and cash
dividends.

The Company has maintained its favorable bond ratings (AAA by Standard & Poor's
Corporation and Aa1 by Moody's Investors Service) and continues to have readily
available financial resources, including unused domestic lines of credit of
$300 million at September 30, 1994.

During the first nine months 1994, the Company continued its program to purchase
its common shares.  The Company purchased and retired 15,376,000 shares during
this period at a cost of $446 million.  As of September 30, 1994, an additional
18,725,000 shares may be purchased in future periods under authorization granted
by the Board of Directors in September 1994.


LEGISLATIVE ISSUES

The Company's primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial
government regulation.  In the U.S., comprehensive legislation may be enacted
that could make significant changes to the availability, delivery and payment
for health care products and services.  International operations are also
subject to a significant degree of government regulation.  It is not possible to
predict the extent to which the Company or the health care industry in general
might be adversely affected by these factors in the future.  A more complete
discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, in the Annual
Report on Form 10-K, which is available upon request.

               PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

          The Company's 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 1994 described 19
antitrust suits (as of June 30, 1994) regarding the pricing of prescription
pharmaceuticals.  Nine additional lawsuits have been filed since June 30, 1994.
Five of these lawsuits were filed in federal court in the Northern District of
Illinois.  These five cases were filed on July 1, August 1, August 18, August 31
and September 16, 1994, respectively.  In addition, on July 7, 1994, a case was
filed in federal court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania; on July 12,
1994, a case was filed in state court in San Francisco County, California; on
July 28, 1994, a case was filed in state court in Dane County, Wisconsin; and,
on July 28, 1994, a case was filed in federal court in the Eastern District of
Missouri.  The cases that were filed in Pennsylvania and in California both
purport to be statewide class actions on behalf of retail pharmacies.  The
plaintiffs in these nine cases seek unspecified treble damages, attorneys' fees,
and declaratory and injunctive relief and have named the Company and numerous
other pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers as defendants.  As of
September 30, 1994, the Company has been named as a defendant in 28 pending
antitrust suits regarding the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals. The
Company intends to defend itself in these lawsuits and to deny all substantive
allegations.

     NOTE:     For the purpose of calculating this ratio, (i) earnings have been
               calculated by adjusting net earnings for taxes on earnings;
               interest expense; capitalized interest cost, net of amortization;
               minority interest; and the portion of rentals representative of
               the interest factor, (ii) the Company considers one-third of
               rental expense to be the amount representing return on capital,
               and (iii) fixed charges comprise total interest expense,
               including capitalized interest and such portion of rentals.
