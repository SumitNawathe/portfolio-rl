                                     (UNAUDITED)



NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PREPARATION:

The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and footnote
disclosures normally included in audited financial statements.  However, in the
opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments)
necessary to present fairly the financial position, cash flows, and results of
operations have been made.  It is suggested that these statements be read in
conjunction with the financial statements included in the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1995.


NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE:

Earnings per common share amounts are computed by using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding.  These shares averaged 784,547,000 for the
six months ended June 30, 1996 and 799,246,000 for the same period in 1995.


NOTE 3 - TAXES ON EARNINGS:

Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective tax rates.  The
effective tax rates are less than the statutory U.S. Federal Income tax rate
principally due to tax incentive grants related to subsidiaries operating in
Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Italy, Ireland, and the Netherlands.

NOTES  TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(UNAUDITED), CONTINUED



NOTE 4 - LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:

The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings including
numerous antitrust suits and investigations in connection with the sale and
marketing of infant formula products and the pricing of prescription
pharmaceuticals.

In addition, the Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party
for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United
States and Puerto Rico under Federal remediation laws and is voluntarily
investigating potential contamination at a number of Company-owned locations.

The matters above are discussed more fully in Item 1, Business - Environmental
Matters, and Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, which
is available upon request, and in Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings, in this
Form.

The Company expects that within the next year, progress in the legal proceedings
described above may cause a change in the estimated reserves recorded by the
Company.  While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending
claims, proceedings, investigations and remediation activities with certainty,
management is of the opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows, or
results of operations.


NOTE 5 - ACQUISITION OF MEDISENSE:

In May 1996, the Company acquired, for cash, substantially all of the 
outstanding shares of MediSense, Inc. (MediSense), a manufacturer of blood 
glucose self-testing products.  The Company is finalizing the appraisal to 
determine the purchase price allocation.  However, a substantial portion of 
the purchase price is expected to be allocated to intangible assets, 
including goodwill, which will be amortized on a straight-line basis over up 
to 40 years. In addition, $35.2 million was charged against earnings for 
in-process research and development.  Had this acquisition occurred on 
January 1, 1995, consolidated sales and net income would not have been 
significantly different from reported amounts.

FINANCIAL REVIEW


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS 1996 COMPARED WITH
SAME PERIODS IN 1995

Worldwide sales for the second quarter and first six months increased
8.0 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively, over the comparable 1995 periods.
Net earnings increased 10.9 percent and 13.0 percent, respectively, in  the
second quarter and first six months 1996.  Earnings per share increased 13.2
percent and 15.2 percent, respectively, over the prior year periods.

Gross profit margin (sales less cost of products sold, including freight and
distribution expenses) was 57.6 percent for the 1996 second quarter, compared to
56.6 percent for the 1995 second quarter.  First half gross margin was
57.2 percent, compared to 56.7 percent a year earlier.  These increases are due
primarily to favorable product mix, especially higher sales of pharmaceuticals,
and productivity improvements; partially offset by higher project expenses for
new products and the effects of inflation.

Research and development expenses were $304.8 million and $573.5 million for 
the second quarter and first six months 1996, respectively, including $35.2 
million of acquired research and development related to the purchase of 
MediSense.  The second quarter and six month 1995 results included a similar 
charge for the acquisition of certain technologies.  Research and development 
represented 11.3 percent and 10.7 percent of net sales, compared to 11.5 
percent and 10.6 percent in 1995.  The majority of research and development 
expenditures continues to be concentrated on pharmaceutical and diagnostic 
products.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter and first 
six months 1996 increased 12.5 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively, over 
the comparable prior year periods, net of the favorable effect of the 
relatively stronger U.S. dollar of 2.4 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively. 
The net increases reflect additional selling and marketing support for new 
and existing products, primarily for pharmaceutical and nutritional products, 
partially offset for the six months 1996 by lower litigation expenses and 
because no contributions were made to the Company's charitable foundation in 
1996.

Other (income) expense, net, includes net foreign exchange losses of
$3.8 million and $13.2 million, respectively, for the second quarter and first
six months 1996 compared with net foreign exchange losses of $7.1 million and
$15.5 million for the corresponding prior year periods.

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

Industry segment sales for the second quarter and first six months 1996 and the
related change from the comparable 1995 periods are shown in the table below.
The Pharmaceutical and Nutritional Products segment includes a broad line of
adult and pediatric pharmaceuticals and nutritionals, which are sold primarily
on the prescription or recommendation of physicians or other health care
professionals; consumer products; agricultural and chemical products; and bulk
pharmaceuticals.  The Hospital and Laboratory Products segment includes
diagnostic systems for blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories and
alternate-care testing sites, and consumers; intravenous and irrigation fluids
and related administration equipment; drugs and drug delivery systems;
anesthetics; critical care products; and other medical specialty products for
hospitals and alternate-care sites.

Domestic and international sales for the second quarter and first six months
1996 primarily reflect unit growth. International sales were unfavorably
affected 5.3 percent by the relatively stronger dollar in the second quarter.
On a year-to-date basis, international sales were unfavorably affected 2.8
percent by the relatively stronger U.S. dollar.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AT JUNE 30, 1996
COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 1995

Net cash from operating activities for the first six months 1996 totaled
$1.179 billion.  The Company expects annual cash flow from operating activities
to continue to approximate or exceed the company's capital expenditures and cash
dividends.  The Company funded the acquisition of MediSense through commercial
paper borrowings.

The Company has maintained its favorable bond ratings (AAA by Standard & Poor's
Corporation and Aa1 by Moody's Investors Service) and continues to have readily
available financial resources, including unused domestic lines of credit of
$1.5 billion at June 30, 1996.  These lines of credit back up domestic
commercial paper borrowing arrangements.

During the first six months 1996, the Company continued its program to purchase
its common shares.  The Company purchased and retired 8,415,000 shares during
this period at a cost of $351 million.  As of June 30, 1996, an additional
4,955,000 shares may be purchased in future periods under authorization granted
by the Board of Directors in September 1995.

In June 1996, the Company filed a registration statement with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.  The Company may issue up to $650 million of debt
securities in the future under this registration statement.

LEGISLATIVE ISSUES

The Company's primary markets are highly competitive and subject to 
substantial government regulation.  The Company expects debate to continue at 
both the federal and the state levels over the availability, method of 
delivery, and payment for health care products and services.  The Company 
believes that if legislation is enacted, it could have the effect of reducing 
prices, or reducing the rate of price increases for medical products and 
services.  International operations are also subject to a significant degree 
of government regulation. It is not possible to predict the extent to which 
the Company or the health care industry in general might be adversely 
affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these 
factors is contained in Item 1, Business, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, 
which is available upon request.

                             PART II.   OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         The Company's 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 1996 
described 23 antitrust suits, one shareholder derivative suit, and 5 
investigations that had been brought in connection with the Company's 
marketing and sale of infant formula products.  It also reported that the 
Company had entered into an agreement to settle 20 of these 23 antitrust 
suits; that one of the 20 cases covered by the agreement had been finally 
settled; and that the settlement of each of the remaining 19 cases would only 
become final when it had been approved by the court in the state where it was 
pending.  On June 7, 1996 the court in Wisconsin gave its final approval to 
the settlement of the two cases that were pending in that state.  The 
settlements of the 17 remaining cases have not yet been finalized. On June 
11, 1996 the Illinois Court of Appeals (First District) dismissed plaintiff's 
appeal of the previous dismissal of the one shareholder derivative 
suit that had been pending before it.  As of June 30, 1996, a total of 20 
antitrust suits and 5 investigations are pending in connection with the 
Company's marketing and sale of infant formula products.

         The Company's 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 1996
reported that the Company had entered into a settlement agreement for the class
action portion of litigation that is pending in federal court in Chicago,
Illinois and is known as IN RE:  BRAND NAME PRESCRIPTION DRUG ANTITRUST
LITIGATION, MDL 997; that the settlement agreement had to be approved by the
federal court before it became final and effective; that on April 4, 1996, the
federal court disapproved the settlement agreement; and that the Company had
filed a request for permission to seek an interlocutory appeal of the denial of
the settlement agreement to the Federal Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit.  On May 16, 1996 the court denied this request.  As of June 30, 1996,
139 cases and one Federal Trade Commission investigation are pending in
connection with the Company's pricing of brand name prescription
pharmaceuticals.

         The Company's 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 1996
reported that on March 15, 1996, the North Carolina Department of Environment,
Health, and Natural Resources ("DEHNR") issued a Notice of Initiation of
Enforcement Action to the Company alleging that during the period between 1987
and 1993 the Company violated certain air quality regulations in North Carolina.
On July 1, 1996 the Company received a civil penalty assessment from the DEHNR
for $968,763.58 in connection with this enforcement action.  The Company is
contesting the assessment.

         While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending 
claims, proceedings, and investigations with certainty, management is of the 
opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse 
effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows, or results of 
operations.

ABBOTT LABORATORIES 1996 INCENTIVE STOCK PROGRAM                    EXHIBIT 10.1
- ------------------------------------------------------------------
  1.  PURPOSE.  The  purpose of  the  Abbott Laboratories  1996  Incentive Stock
Program (the "Program") is to attract and retain outstanding directors, officers
and other employees of Abbott Laboratories (the "Company") and its subsidiaries,
and to furnish incentives to such persons by providing opportunities to  acquire
common  shares of the Company,  or monetary payments based  on the value of such
shares or the  financial performance of  the Company, or  both, on  advantageous
terms as herein provided and to further align such persons' interests with those
of  the Company's other  shareholders through compensation that  is based on the
value of the Company's common shares.
 
  2. ADMINISTRATION.  The  Program will  be  administered by  a  committee  (the
"Committee")  of at  least two  persons which  shall be  either the Compensation
Committee of  the Board  of Directors  of the  Company or  such other  committee
comprised  entirely  of persons  who are  both:  (i) "disinterested  persons" as
defined in  Rule 16b-3  of  the Securities  and  Exchange Commission;  and  (ii)
"outside directors" as defined under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code
of  1986, as amended; or any successor  provision, as the Board of Directors may
from time  to  time  designate.  The  Committee  shall  interpret  the  Program,
prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating thereto and make all
other  determinations  necessary  or  advisable for  the  administration  of the
Program. A majority of  the members of the  Committee shall constitute a  quorum
and  all determinations  of the  Committee shall  be made  by a  majority of its
members. Any  determination of  the  Committee under  the  Program may  be  made
without  notice of meeting  of the Committee by  a writing signed  by all of the
Committee members. The Committee may, from time to time, delegate any or all  of
its  duties, powers  and authority  to any officer  or officers  of the Company,
except to the extent  such delegation would be  inconsistent with Rule 16b-3  of
the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  or  other  applicable  law,  rule or
regulation. The Chief  Executive Officer of  the Company may,  on behalf of  the
Committee,  grant stock options  and restricted stock  awards under the Program,
other than to persons subject  to Section 16 of  the Securities Exchange Act  of
1934.  All such grants by  the Chief Executive Officer  must be reported to, and
ratified by,  the Committee  within twelve  months  of the  grant date  but,  if
ratified, shall be effective as of the grant date.
 
  3. PARTICIPANTS. Participants in the Program will consist of such officers and
other employees of the Company and its subsidiaries as the Committee in its sole
discretion  may designate from  time to time to  receive Benefits hereunder. The
Committee's designation  of a  participant in  any year  shall not  require  the
Committee  to designate such person to receive  a Benefit in any other year. The
Committee shall  consider  such  factors  as it  deems  pertinent  in  selecting
participants  and  in  determining  the  type  and  amount  of  their respective
Benefits, including  without  limitation  (i) the  financial  condition  of  the
Company;  (ii)  anticipated  profits  for the  current  or  future  years; (iii)
contributions of  participants  to  the profitability  and  development  of  the
Company;  (iv) prior awards to participants; and (v) other compensation provided
to participants.  Non-Employee  Directors  shall also  be  participants  in  the
Program solely for purposes of receiving Restricted Stock Awards under paragraph
13  and Non-qualified Stock  Options under paragraph  14. The term "Non-Employee
Director" shall mean a member of the  Board of Directors who is not a  full-time
employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
 
  4.  TYPES OF BENEFITS. Benefits under the Program may be granted in any one or
a combination of (a) Incentive  Stock Options; (b) Non-qualified Stock  Options;
(c)  Stock  Appreciation  Rights;  (d) Limited  Stock  Appreciation  Rights; (e)
Restricted Stock  Awards;  (f) Performance  Awards;  and (g)  Foreign  Qualified
Benefits, all as described below.
 
  5.  SHARES RESERVED UNDER  THE PROGRAM. There is  hereby reserved for issuance
under the Program: (i) an aggregate  of Five Million (5,000,000) common  shares;
plus  (ii) an authorization for each  calendar year (the "Annual Authorization")
from and including  1996, of  seven-tenths of one  percent (0.7%)  of the  total
common  shares of the Company issued and outstanding as of the first day of such
calendar year; which may be newly  issued or treasury shares. The shares  hereby
reserved  are in addition to the  shares previously reserved under the Company's
1981 Incentive Stock Program,  1986 Incentive Stock  Program and 1991  Incentive
Stock  Program (the "Prior  Programs"). Any common  shares reserved for issuance
under the Prior Programs in excess of  the number of shares as to which  options
or  other Benefits have been awarded on the date of shareholder approval of this
Program, plus any  such shares  as to which  options or  other Benefits  granted
under  the Prior Programs may lapse, expire, terminate or be canceled after such
date, shall  also be  reserved and  available for  issuance in  connection  with
Benefits  under this Program.  Any common shares reserved  under the Program for
any calendar year  under an Annual  Authorization as to  which options or  other
Benefits  have not  been awarded as  of the end  of such calendar  year shall be
available for issuance in connection with Benefits granted in subsequent years.
 
If there is  a lapse,  expiration, termination  or cancellation  of any  Benefit
granted  hereunder without the issuance of shares or payment of cash thereunder,
or if shares are issued under any  Benefit and thereafter are reacquired by  the
Company  pursuant to  rights reserved upon  the issuance thereof,  or shares are
reacquired pursuant to the payment of  the purchase price of shares under  stock
options by delivery of other common shares of the Company, the shares subject to
or  reserved  for such  Benefit, or  so reacquired,  may again  be used  for new
options, rights or awards of any  sort authorized under this Program;  provided,
however,  that in  no event may  the number  of common shares  issued under this
Program, and not
 
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A-1
<PAGE>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
reacquired by the Company pursuant to rights reserved upon the issuance  thereof
or  pursuant to the payment of the  purchase price of shares under stock options
by delivery of other common  shares of the Company,  exceed the total number  of
shares reserved for issuance hereunder.
 
  6. INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS. Incentive Stock Options will consist of options to
purchase  common shares  at purchase  prices not  less than  One Hundred percent
(100%) of the Fair Market Value of such  common shares on the date of grant.  An
Incentive  Stock Option will not be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10)
years from the  date such  option is  granted. In  the event  of termination  of
employment  for any reason other than retirement, disability or death, the right
of the optionee to exercise an  Incentive Stock Option shall terminate upon  the
earlier  of the end of the original term of the option or three (3) months after
the optionee's last day  of work for  the Company and  its subsidiaries. In  the
event  of termination of employment  due to retirement or  disability, or if the
optionee should die  while employed, the  right of  the optionee or  his or  her
successor in interest to exercise an Incentive Stock Option shall terminate upon
the  end of the original  term of the option. If  the optionee should die within
three (3)  months after  termination of  employment for  any reason  other  than
retirement  or disability,  the right  of his  or her  successor in  interest to
exercise an Incentive Stock Option shall  terminate upon the earlier of the  end
of  the original term of the  option or three (3) months  after the date of such
death. To the extent the aggregate fair market value (determined as of the  time
the  Option is granted) of the common shares with respect to which any Incentive
Stock Option is  exercisable for  the first time  by any  individual during  any
calendar  year  (under  all  option  plans of  the  Company  and  its subsidiary
corporations) exceeds $100,000, the excess  shall be treated as a  Non-qualified
Stock  Option. An Incentive  Stock Option shall be  exercisable as determined by
the Committee, but in no event earlier than six (6) months from its grant date.
 
  7. NON-QUALIFIED STOCK  OPTIONS. Non-qualified Stock  Options will consist  of
options  to purchase common shares at purchase  prices not less than One Hundred
percent (100%) of the  Fair Market Value  of such common shares  on the date  of
grant. A Non-qualified Stock Option will not be exercisable after the expiration
of  ten  (10) years  from  the date  such  option is  granted.  In the  event of
termination of employment for  any reason other  than retirement, disability  or
death,  the right of the optionee to exercise a Non-qualified Stock Option shall
terminate upon the  earlier of the  end of the  original term of  the option  or
three  (3) months after the optionee's last day  of work for the Company and its
subsidiaries. In the  event of termination  of employment due  to retirement  or
disability,  or if  the optionee  should die  while employed,  the right  of the
optionee or his or her successor  in interest to exercise a Non-qualified  Stock
Option  shall terminate upon the end of the  original term of the option. If the
optionee should die within three (3) months after termination of employment  for
any  reason  other  than retirement  or  disability,  the right  of  his  or her
successor in interest to exercise  a Non-qualified Stock Option shall  terminate
upon  the earlier of  the end of  the original term  of the option  or three (3)
months after  the date  of such  death. A  Non-qualified Stock  Option shall  be
exercisable as determined by the Committee, but in no event earlier than six (6)
months from its grant date.
 
  8.  STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.  The Committee may, in  its discretion, grant a
Stock Appreciation Right to the holder of any stock option granted hereunder  or
under  the Prior  Programs. Such Stock  Appreciation Rights shall  be subject to
such terms and  conditions consistent with  the Program as  the Committee  shall
impose from time to time, including the following:
 
    (a) A Stock Appreciation Right may be granted with respect to a stock option
  at  the time of its grant or at any time thereafter up to six (6) months prior
  to its expiration.
 
    (b) Stock  Appreciation  Rights will  permit  the holder  to  surrender  any
  related stock option or portion thereof which is then exercisable and to elect
  to receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to:
 
      (i)  The excess of the  Fair Market Value on the  date of such election of
    one common share over the option price multiplied by
 
      (ii) The number of shares covered by such option or portion thereof  which
    is so surrendered.
 
    (c)  A Stock Appreciation Right  granted to a participant  who is subject to
  Section 16  of  the  Securities Exchange  Act  of  1934, as  amended,  may  be
  exercised  only after six (6) months from its grant date (unless such exercise
  would not affect the exemption under Rule 16b-3 of the Securities and Exchange
  Commission).
 
    (d) A Stock Appreciation Right may be granted to a participant regardless of
  whether such participant has been  granted a Limited Stock Appreciation  Right
  with respect to the same stock option. However, a Stock Appreciation Right may
  not  be exercised  during any period  that a Limited  Stock Appreciation Right
  with respect to the same stock option may be exercised.
 
    (e) In the event of the exercise  of a Stock Appreciation Right, the  number
  of  shares reserved for issuance  hereunder shall be reduced  by the number of
  shares covered by the stock option or portion thereof surrendered.

<PAGE>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  9. LIMITED STOCK APPRECIATION  RIGHTS. The Committee  may, in its  discretion,
grant  a Limited  Stock Appreciation  Right to  the holder  of any  stock option
granted hereunder or under the  Prior Programs. Such Limited Stock  Appreciation
Rights shall be subject to such terms and conditions consistent with the Program
as the Committee shall impose from time to time, including the following:
 
    (a)  A Limited  Stock Appreciation  Right may be  granted with  respect to a
  stock option at the time of its grant or at any time thereafter up to six  (6)
  months prior to its expiration.
 
    (b)  A Limited Stock Appreciation Right  will permit the holder to surrender
  any related stock option or portion  thereof which is then exercisable and  to
  receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to:
 
      (i)  The excess of the  Fair Market Value on the  date of such election of
    one common share over the option price multiplied by
 
      (ii) The number of shares covered by such option or portion thereof  which
    is so surrendered.
 
    (c)  A  Limited Stock  Appreciation Right  granted to  a participant  who is
  subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,  may
  be  exercised  only after  six (6)  months  from its  grant date  (unless such
  exercise would not affect the exemption under Rule 16b-3 of the Securities and
  Exchange Commission) and only during the  sixty (60) day period commencing  on
  the  later of: (i) the day following the  date of a Change in Control; or (ii)
  the first date on which such exercise would be exempt under Rule 16b-3 of  the
  Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
    (d)  A  Limited Stock  Appreciation Right  may be  granted to  a participant
  regardless of whether such participant  has been granted a Stock  Appreciation
  Right with respect to the same stock option.
 
    (e)  In the event of the exercise of a Limited Stock Appreciation Right, the
  number of  shares reserved  for issuance  hereunder shall  be reduced  by  the
  number of shares covered by the stock option or portion thereof surrendered.
 
  10.  RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS.  Restricted Stock Awards  will consist of common
shares transferred to participants without other payment therefor as  additional
compensation  for  their services  to the  Company or  any of  its subsidiaries.
Restricted Stock Awards granted under this paragraph 10 shall be satisfied  from
the  Company's  available  treasury  shares. Restricted  Stock  Awards  shall be
subject to such terms  and conditions as  the Committee determines  appropriate,
including,  without limitation, restrictions on the sale or other disposition of
such shares and rights of the Company to reacquire such shares upon  termination
of  the participant's employment within specified periods. Subject to such other
restrictions as are  imposed by the  Committee, the common  shares covered by  a
Restricted  Stock Award granted to a participant who is subject to Section 16 of
the Securities  Exchange Act  of 1934,  as  amended, may  be sold  or  otherwise
disposed  of only after six (6) months from  the grant date of the award (unless
such sale would not affect the exemption under Rule 16b-3 of the Securities  and
Exchange  Commission). No  more than  ten percent (10%)  of the  total number of
shares available for  grant in  any calendar year  may be  issued as  Restricted
Stock Awards under paragraphs 10 and 13 in that year.
 
  11. PERFORMANCE AWARDS. Performance Awards in the form of Performance Units or
Performance Shares may be granted to any participant in the Program. Performance
Units  shall consist of monetary awards which may  be earned in whole or in part
if the  Company achieves  certain  goals established  by  the Committee  over  a
designated  period of time. Performance Shares shall consist of common shares or
awards denominated in common shares which may  be earned in whole or in part  if
the  Company  achieves  certain  goals  established  by  the  Committee  over  a
designated period of time. The goals established by the Committee shall be based
on any one, or combination of, earnings  per share, return on equity, return  on
assets,  total shareholder return, net operating  income, cash flow, increase in
revenue, economic value added,  increase in share price  or cash flow return  on
investment.  Partial  achievement of  the  goal(s) may  result  in a  payment or
vesting corresponding to the degree of  achievement. Payment of an award  earned
may  be in cash or in common shares or in a combination of both, and may be made
when earned,  or may  be  vested and  deferred, as  the  Committee in  its  sole
discretion  determines.  The  maximum  amount which  may  be  granted  under all
Performance Awards  for any  one year  for  any one  participant shall  be  Five
Million  Dollars ($5,000,000). This limit shall be applied to Performance Shares
by multiplying the number of Performance Shares granted by the fair market value
of one common share on the date of  the award. This paragraph 11 is intended  to
comply with the performance-based compensation requirements of Section 162(m) of
the  Internal Revenue  Code of  1986, as  amended, and  shall be  interpreted in
accordance with the rules and regulations thereunder.
 
  12. FOREIGN QUALIFIED BENEFITS. Benefits under  the Program may be granted  to
such  employees of the Company and its  subsidiaries who are residing in foreign
jurisdictions as the Committee in its sole discretion may determine from time to
time. The  Committee  may  adopt such  supplements  to  the Program  as  may  be
necessary  to comply with the applicable  laws of such foreign jurisdictions and
to afford participants favorable treatment  under such laws; provided,  however,
that  no  Benefit shall  be  granted under  any  such supplement  with  terms or
conditions which are  inconsistent with the  provisions as set  forth under  the
Program.

    (a)  Each person elected  a Non-Employee Director  at an annual shareholders
  meeting in any of the years 1996 through 2005 shall receive a Restricted Stock
  Award on the dates of their election covering a number of common shares with a
  fair market value on the date of the  award closest to, but not in excess  of,
  Twenty-Two  Thousand Dollars ($22,000)  for awards made  in years 1996 through
  2000 and Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) for awards made in years  2001
  through 2005.
 
    (b)  ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES. As soon  as practicable following the date of
the  award  the  Company  shall  issue  certificates  ("Certificates")  to   the
Non-Employee  Director receiving  the award,  representing the  number of common
shares covered by the award. Each Certificate shall bear a legend describing the
restrictions on such shares imposed by this paragraph 13.
 
    (c) RIGHTS. Upon issuance of the Certificates, the directors in whose  names
they  are registered  shall, subject to  the restrictions of  this paragraph 13,
have all of the rights of a  shareholder with respect to the shares  represented
by  the Certificates, including the  right to vote such  shares and receive cash
dividends and other distributions thereon.
 
    (d) RESTRICTED  PERIOD. The  shares  covered by  awards granted  under  this
paragraph  13 may  not be sold  or otherwise  disposed of within  six (6) months
following their grant  date (unless  such sale  would not  affect the  exemption
under  Rule 16b-3  of the  Securities and  Exchange Commission)  and in addition
shall be subject  to the restrictions  of this  paragraph 13 for  a period  (the
"Restricted  Period") commencing with  the date of  the award and  ending on the
earliest of the following events:
 
      (i) The date the director terminates or retires from the Board;
 
      (ii) The date the director dies; or
 
      (iii) The  date  of occurrence  of  a Change  in  Control (as  defined  in
    paragraph 21(c)).
 
    (e)  RESTRICTIONS. All shares covered by awards granted under this paragraph
13 shall be subject to the following restrictions during the Restricted Period:
 
      (i)  The  shares  may  not   be  sold,  assigned,  transferred,   pledged,
    hypothecated or otherwise disposed of.
 
      (ii)  Any additional common  shares of the Company  or other securities or
    property issued with respect to shares covered by awards granted under  this
    paragraph   13  as  a   result  of  any  stock   dividend,  stock  split  or
    reorganization, shall be subject to the restrictions and other provisions of
    this paragraph 13.
 
      (iii) A director  shall not  be entitled to  receive any  shares prior  to
    completion  of all actions deemed appropriate  by the Company to comply with
    federal or state securities laws and stock exchange requirements.
 
    (f) Except in  the event of  conflict, all provisions  of the Program  shall
  apply  to  this  paragraph  13.  In the  event  of  any  conflict  between the
  provisions of  the Program  and this  paragraph 13,  this paragraph  13  shall
  control.  Those provisions  of paragraph 17  which authorize  the Committee to
  declare outstanding  restricted stock  awards to  be vested  and to  amend  or
  modify  the terms  of Benefits  shall not apply  to awards  granted under this
  paragraph 13. Restricted Stock Awards granted under this paragraph 13 shall be
  satisfied from the Company's available treasury shares.
 
  14. NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS.
 
    (a) Each Non-Employee Director may elect to receive any or all of his or her
  fees earned during the second half  of 1996 and each subsequent calendar  year
  under  Section 3 of  the Abbott Laboratories  Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan
  (the "Directors' Fee Plan") in the  form of Non-qualified Stock Options  under
  this  Section 14. Each such election shall be irrevocable, and must be made in
  writing and filed with the Secretary of the Company by December 31, 1995  (for
  fees  earned in the  second half of  1996) and (for  fees earned in subsequent
  calendar years) by June 30 of the calendar year preceding the calendar year in
  which such fees are  earned (or such  later date as  may be permissible  under
  Rule  16b-3 of the Securities  and Exchange Commission, but  in no event later
  than December 31 of such preceding calendar year).
 
    (b) A  Non-Employee Director  may file  a new  election each  calendar  year
  applicable  to fees earned in the  immediately succeeding calendar year. If no
  new election or revocation of a prior  election is received by June 30 of  any
  calendar  year (or such later date as may be permissible under paragraph (a)),
  the election,  if any,  in effect  for such  calendar year  shall continue  in
  effect  for the immediately succeeding calendar  year. Any election made under
  this Section 14 shall take precedence  over any election made by the  director
  for the same period, under the Directors' Fee Plan, to the extent necessary to
  resolve  any conflict between such elections. If  a director does not elect to
  receive his or her fees in the  form of Non-qualified Stock Options, the  fees
  due  such director shall be paid or deferred as provided in the Directors' Fee
  Plan and any applicable election thereunder by the director.

                                                                             A-4
<PAGE>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
    (c) The number of common shares  covered by each Non-qualified Stock  Option
  granted  in any  year under this  Section 14  shall be determined  based on an
  independent appraisal for such year of the intrinsic value of options  granted
  hereunder  and the amount of fees covered  by the director's election for such
  year. The  number of  common shares  covered by  options granted  in 1996  (as
  determined  under this procedure) shall be the number of whole shares equal to
  (i) the product of three (3) times  the amount of fees which the director  has
  elected  under paragraph  (a) to  receive in  the form  of Non-qualified Stock
  Options, divided by (ii) One Hundred  percent (100%) of the Fair Market  Value
  of  one common  share on  the grant  date. Any  fraction of  a share  shall be
  disregarded, and the remaining amount of the fees corresponding to such option
  shall be  paid as  provided in  the  Directors' Fee  Plan and  any  applicable
  election thereunder by the director.
 
    (d)  Each Non-qualified  Stock Option due  a director under  this Section 14
  shall be  issued as  of the  date  the corresponding  fees otherwise  due  the
  director  would have been paid under the Directors' Fee Plan and at a purchase
  price equal to  One Hundred percent  (100%) of  the Fair Market  Value of  the
  common shares covered by such option on the grant date. Each such option shall
  be  fully exercisable after six (6) months  from the grant date, and shall not
  be exercisable after  the expiration of  ten (10) years  from the grant  date.
  Each  such option  shall contain provisions  allowing payment  of the purchase
  price, and any taxes due on the  exercise, by delivery of other common  shares
  of  the  Company (or,  in  the case  of payment  of  taxes, by  withholding of
  shares).
 
  15. NONTRANSFERABILITY. Except as provided by the Committee, each stock option
and  stock  appreciation  right  granted   under  this  Program  shall  not   be
transferable  other than by  will or the  laws of descent  and distribution, and
shall be exercisable, during the participant's lifetime, only by the participant
or the participant's guardian or legal representative.
 
  16. OTHER PROVISIONS. The award of any  Benefit under the Program may also  be
subject to other provisions (whether or not applicable to the Benefit awarded to
any  other  participant)  as the  Committee  determines  appropriate, including,
without limitation, provisions  for the  purchase of common  shares under  stock
options  in installments,  provisions for the  payment of the  purchase price of
shares under stock  options by delivery  of other common  shares of the  Company
having  a  then  market  value  equal to  the  purchase  price  of  such shares,
restrictions  on  resale  or  other  disposition,  such  provisions  as  may  be
appropriate  to comply with federal or  state securities laws and stock exchange
requirements and understandings or conditions as to the participant's employment
in addition to those specifically provided for under the Program.
 
  In the case of a participant who is subject to Section 16(a) and 16(b) of  the
Securities  Exchange  Act of  1934, the  Committee  may, at  any time,  add such
conditions and limitations to  any Benefit granted to  such participant, or  any
feature  of any such  Benefit, as the  Committee, in its  sole discretion, deems
necessary or desirable to comply with Section  16(a) or 16(b) and the rules  and
regulations thereunder or to obtain any exemption therefrom.
 
  A  participant may  pay the  purchase price of  shares under  stock options by
delivery of  a  properly  executed  exercise notice  together  with  a  copy  of
irrevocable  instructions to  a broker  to deliver  promptly to  the Company the
amount of sale or  loan proceeds to  pay the purchase  price. To facilitate  the
foregoing, the Company may enter into agreements for coordinated procedures with
one or more brokerage firms.
 
  The  Committee may,  in its  discretion and  subject to  such rules  as it may
adopt, permit or require a participant to  pay all or a portion of the  federal,
state  and local taxes, including FICA  and medicare withholding tax, arising in
connection with the following transactions: (a) the exercise of a  Non-qualified
Stock  Option; (b)  the lapse  of restrictions  on common  shares received  as a
Restricted Stock Award; or (c) the receipt or exercise of any other Benefit;  by
(i) having the Company withhold common shares, (ii) tendering back common shares
received  in connection with  such Benefit or  (iii) delivering other previously
acquired common shares of the Company  having a fair market value  approximately
equal to the amount to be withheld.
 
  The  Committee  may grant  stock  options under  the  Program (and,  for stock
options granted  prior  to  shareholder  approval of  this  Program,  under  the
Company's   1991  Incentive  Stock  Program)  that  provide  for  the  grant  of
replacement stock options if all or any  portion of the purchase price or  taxes
incurred  in connection with the exercise, are paid by delivery (or, in the case
of payment of taxes,  by withholding of  shares) of other  common shares of  the
Company.  The replacement stock  option shall cover the  number of common shares
surrendered to pay the purchase price, plus the number of shares surrendered  or
withheld  to satisfy  the participant's  tax liability,  shall have  an exercise
price equal to  One Hundred  percent (100%)  of the  Fair Market  Value of  such
common  shares on the date such replacement stock option is granted, shall first
be exercisable six months from the date of grant of the replacement stock option
and shall have an expiration date equal  to the expiration date of the  original
stock option.
 
  17.  TERM OF PROGRAM AND AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION, CANCELLATION OR ACCELERATION
OF BENEFITS. The Program shall continue in effect until terminated by the  Board
of  Directors of  the Company,  except that no  Incentive Stock  Option shall be
granted more than ten (10) years after the date of adoption of this Program. The
terms and conditions applicable to any
 
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A-5
<PAGE>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Benefits may at any  time be amended, modified  or canceled by mutual  agreement
between the Committee and the participant or such other persons as may then have
an  interest therein, so long as any amendment or modification does not increase
the number of common shares issuable  under this Program; and provided  further,
that  the Committee may, at any time and  in its sole discretion, declare any or
all stock  options and  stock appreciation  rights then  outstanding under  this
Program  or the Prior Programs to be exercisable and any or all then outstanding
Restricted Stock Awards  to be vested,  whether or not  such options, rights  or
awards are then otherwise exercisable or vested.
 
  18. AMENDMENT TO PRIOR PROGRAMS. No options or other Benefits shall be granted
under  the Prior Programs on  or after the date  of shareholder approval of this

                    ABBOTT LABORATORIES SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PLAN

                                      SECTION 1
                                     INTRODUCTION

    1-1.  On September 9, 1977, December 14, 1979 and February 10, 1984 the
Board of Directors of Abbott Laboratories ("Abbott") adopted certain resolutions
providing for payment of (i) pension benefits calculated under the Abbott
Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan ("Annuity Plan") in excess of those which
may be paid under that plan under the limits imposed by Section 415 of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act ("ERISA") and (ii) the additional pension benefits that would be payable
under the Annuity Plan if deferred awards under the Abbott Laboratories
Management Incentive Plan were included in "final earnings" as defined in the
Annuity Plan.

    The purpose of this ABBOTT LABORATORIES SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PLAN (the
"Supplemental Plan") is to clarify, restate and supersede the prior resolutions.

    1-2.  The Supplemental Plan shall apply to employees of Abbott and its
subsidiaries and affiliates existing as of the date of adoption of the
Supplemental Plan or thereafter created or acquired.  (Abbott and each of such
subsidiaries and affiliates are hereinafter referred to as an "employer" and
collectively as the "employers").

    1-3.  All benefits provided under the Supplemental Plan shall be provided
from the general assets of the employers and not from any trust fund or other

<PAGE>


                                         -2-

designated asset.  All participants in the Supplemental Plan shall be general
creditors of the employers with no priority over other creditors.

    1-4.  The Supplemental Plan shall be administered by the Abbott
Laboratories Employee Benefit Board of Review appointed and acting under the
Annuity Plan ("Board of Review").  Except as stated below, the Board of Review
shall perform all powers and duties with respect to the Supplemental Plan,
including the power to direct payment of benefits, allocate costs among
employers, adopt amendments and determine questions of interpretation.  The
Board of Directors of Abbott shall have the sole authority to terminate the
Supplemental Plan.

                                      SECTION 2
                       ERISA ANNUITY PLAN SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFIT

    2-1.  The benefits described in this Section 2 shall apply to all
participants in the Annuity Plan who retire, or terminate with a vested pension
under that plan, on or after September 9, 1977.

    2-2.  Each Annuity Plan participant whose retirement or vested pension
under that plan would otherwise be limited by Section 415, Internal Revenue
Code, shall receive a supplemental pension under this Supplemental Plan in an
amount, which, when added to his or her Annuity Plan pension, will equal the
amount the participant would be entitled to under the Annuity Plan as in effect
from time to time, based on the particular option selected by the participant,
without regard to the limitations imposed by Section 415, Internal Revenue Code.

                                      SECTION 3
                       1986 TAX REFORM ACT SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFIT

    3-1.  The benefits described in this Section 3 shall apply to all
participants in the Annuity Plan who retire, or terminate with a vested pension
under that plan, after December 31, 1988.

<PAGE>


                                         -3-

    3-2.  Each Annuity Plan participant shall receive a supplemental pension
under this Supplemental Plan in an amount determined as follows:

    (a)  The supplemental pension shall be the difference, if any, between:

         (i)  The monthly benefit payable under the Annuity Plan plus any
              supplement provided by Section 2; and

         (ii) The monthly benefit which would have been payable under the
              Annuity Plan (without regard to the limits imposed by Section
              415, Internal Revenue Code) if the participant's "final
              earnings", as defined in the Annuity Plan had included
              compensation in excess of the limits imposed by Section
              401(a)(17), Internal Revenue Code, and any "pre-tax
              contributions" made by the participant under the Abbott
              Laboratories Supplemental 401(k) Plan.

                                      SECTION 4
                    DEFERRED MIP ANNUITY PLAN SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFIT

    4-1.  The benefits described in this Section 4 shall apply to all
participants in the Annuity Plan who retire, or terminate with a vested pension,
under that plan, on or after December 14, 1979 and who were awarded Management
Incentive Plan awards for any calendar year during the ten consecutive calendar
years ending with the year of retirement or termination of employment.

    4-2.  Each Annuity Plan participant shall receive a supplemental pension
under this Supplemental Plan in an amount determined as follows:

    (a)  The supplemental pension shall be the difference, if any, between:

         (i)  The monthly benefit payable under the Annuity Plan plus any
              supplement provided by Section 2 and Section 3; and

         (ii) the monthly benefit which would have been payable under the
              Annuity Plan (without regard to the limits imposed by Section
              415, Internal Revenue Code) if the participant's "final
              earnings", as defined in the Annuity Plan, were one-sixtieth of
              the sum of:

              (A)  the participant's total "basic earnings" (excluding any
                   payments under the Management Incentive Plan or any Division
                   Incentive Plan) received in the sixty consecutive calendar
                   months for which his basic earnings (excluding

<PAGE>


                                         -4-

                   any payments under the Management Incentive Plan or any
                   Division Incentive Plan) were highest within the last one
                   hundred twenty consecutive calendar months immediately
                   preceding his retirement or termination of employment; and

              (B)  the amount of the participant's total awards under the
                   Management Incentive Plan and any Division Incentive Plan
                   (whether paid immediately or deferred) made for the five
                   consecutive calendar years during the ten consecutive
                   calendar years ending with the year of retirement or
                   termination for which such amount is the greatest and (for
                   participants granted Management Incentive Plan awards for
                   less than five consecutive calendar years during such ten
                   year period) which include all Management Incentive Plan
                   awards granted for consecutive calendar years within such
                   ten year period.

    (b)  That portion of any Management Incentive Plan award which the
         Compensation Committee has determined shall be excluded from the
         participant's "basic earnings" shall be excluded from the calculation
         of "final earnings" for purposes of this subsection 4-2.  "Final
         earnings" for purposes of this subsection 4-2 shall include any
         compensation in excess of the limits imposed by Section 401(a)(17),
         Internal Revenue Code.

    (c)  In the event the period described in subsection 4-2(a)(ii)(B) is the
         final five calendar years of employment and a Management Incentive
         Plan award is made to the participant subsequent to retirement for the
         participant's final calendar year of employment, the supplemental
         pension shall be adjusted by adding such new award and subtracting a
         portion of the earliest Management Incentive Plan award included in
         the calculation, from the amount determined under subsection
         4-2(a)(ii)(B).  The portion subtracted shall be equal to that portion
         of the participant's final calendar year of employment during which
         the participant was employed by Abbott.  If such adjustment results in
         a greater supplemental pension, the greater pension shall be paid
         beginning the first month following the date of such new award.

                                      SECTION 5
                     RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFIT
                                           
    5-1.  The benefits described in this Section 5 shall apply to all
participants in the Annuity Plan who retire or terminate with a vested pension,
under that plan, after September 1, 1995.

<PAGE>


                                         -5-

    5-2.  For purposes of this Supplemental Plan, the phrase "Eligible
Restricted Stock Award" shall mean a restricted stock award granted under the
Abbott Laboratories 1991 Incentive Stock Program, or any successor plan or
program, (the "Incentive Stock Program"), which is designated by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Abbott, at any time prior to
retirement or termination of the participant, as includable in "final earnings"
for purposes of this Supplemental Plan.

    5-3.  Each Annuity Plan participant shall receive a supplemental pension
under this Supplemental Plan in an amount determined as follows:

    (a)  The supplemental pension shall be the difference, if any, between:

         (i)  The monthly benefit payable under the Annuity Plan plus any
              supplement provided by Sections 2, 3 and 4;  and

         (ii) The monthly benefit which would have been payable under the
              Annuity Plan (without regard to the limits imposed by Section
              415, Internal Revenue Code) if the participant's "final
              earnings", as defined in the Annuity Plan, were one-sixtieth of
              the sum of:

              (A)  the participant's earnings described in subsection
                   4-2(a)(ii)(A); 

              (B)  the participant's awards described in subsection
                   4-2(a)(ii)(B) (adjusted as provided in subsections 4-2(b)
                   and (c)); and 

              (C)  the total value of those installments of Eligible Restricted
                   Stock Awards granted the participant which become 
                   non-forfeitable during the sixty consecutive calendar 
                   months for which his basic earnings (as defined in 
                   subsection 4-2(a)(ii)(A)) are highest within the last one 
                   hundred twenty consecutive calendar months immediately 
                   preceding his retirement or termination of employment.

    (b)  For purposes of this subsection 5-3:

         (i)  The value of an Eligible Restricted Stock Award shall be the fair
              market value of such award (as determined under the Incentive
              Stock Program) on the date the award is granted;

<PAGE>


                                         -6-

         (ii) No more than five installments of Eligible Restricted Stock
              Awards shall be included in the amount calculated under
              subsection 5-3(a)(ii)(C); and

         (iii)"Final earnings" shall include compensation in excess of the 
              limits imposed by Section 401(a)(17), Internal Revenue Code."

    In the event the limitation described in subsection 5-3(b)(ii) would be
    exceeded for a participant, those installments in excess of five with the
    lowest fair market value (as defined in subsection 5-3(b)(i)) shall be
    disregarded in calculating the benefit due under this Section 5.

                                      SECTION 6
                 CORPORATE OFFICER ANNUITY PLAN SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFIT
                                           
    6-1.  The benefits described in this Section 6 shall apply to all
participants in the Annuity Plan who are corporate officers of Abbott as of
September 30, 1993 or who become corporate officers thereafter, and who retire,
or terminate with a vested pension under that plan on or after September 30,
1993.  The term "corporate officer" for purposes of this Supplemental Plan shall
mean an individual elected an officer of Abbott by its Board of Directors (or
designated as such for purposes of this Section 6 by the Compensation Committee
of the Board of Directors of Abbott), but shall not include assistant officers.

    6-2. Subject to the limitations and adjustments described below, each
participant described in subsection 6-1 shall receive a monthly supplemental
pension under this Supplemental Plan commencing on the participant's normal
retirement date under the Annuity Plan  and payable as a life annuity, equal to
6/10 of 1 percent (.006) of the participant's final earnings (as that phrase is
used in subsection 5-3(a)(ii), adjusted as provided in subsections 5-3(b)(ii)
and (iii)) for each of the first twenty years

<PAGE>


                                         -7-

of the participant's benefit service (as defined in the Annuity Plan) occurring
after the participant's attainment of age 35.


    6-3.  In no event shall the sum of (a) the participant's aggregate
percentage of final earnings calculated under subsection 6-2 and (b) the
participant's aggregate percentage of final earnings calculated under subsection
5-1(b)(i) of the Annuity Plan, exceed the maximum aggregate percentage of final
earnings allowed under subsection 5-1(b)(i) of the Annuity Plan (without regard
to any limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code), as in effect on the date of
the participant's retirement or termination.  In the event the limitation
described in this subsection 6-3 would be exceeded for any participant, the
participant's aggregate percentage calculated under subsection 6-2 shall be
reduced until the limit is not exceeded.

    6-4.  Benefit service occurring between the date a participant ceases to be
a corporate officer of Abbott and the date the participant again becomes a
corporate officer of Abbott shall be disregarded in calculating the
participant's aggregate percentage under subsection 6-2.

    6-5.  Any supplemental pension otherwise due a participant under this
Section 6 shall be reduced by the amount (if any) by which:

    (a)  the sum of (i) the benefits due such participant under the Annuity
         Plan and this Supplemental Plan, plus (ii) the actuarially equivalent
         value of the employer-paid portion of all benefits due such
         participant under the primary retirement plans of all non-Abbott
         employers of such participant; exceeds

    (b)  the maximum benefit that would be due under the Annuity Plan (without
         regard to the limits imposed by Section 415, Internal Revenue Code)
         based on the participant's final earnings (as that phrase is used in
         subsection 5-3(a)(ii), adjusted as provided in subsections 5-3(b)(ii)
         and (iii), if the participant had accrued the maximum benefit service
         recognized by the Annuity Plan.

<PAGE>

                                         -8-

The term "primary retirement plan" shall mean any pension benefit plan as
defined in ERISA, whether or not qualified under the Internal Revenue Code,
which is determined by the Board of Review to be the primary pension plan of its
sponsoring employer.  The term "non-Abbott employer" shall mean any employer
other than Abbott or a subsidiary or affiliate of Abbott.  A retirement plan
maintained by an employer prior to such employer's acquisition by Abbott shall
be deemed a retirement plan maintained by a non-Abbott employer for purposes of
this subsection 6-5.

    6-6. Any supplemental pension due a participant under this Section 6 shall
be actuarially adjusted as provided in the Annuity Plan to reflect the pension
form selected by the participant and the participant's age at commencement of
the pension, and shall be paid as provided in subsection 7-2.

                        SUPPLEMENTAL EARLY RETIREMENT BENEFIT

    7-1.  The benefits described in this Section 7 shall apply to all persons
described in subsection 6-1.

    7-2.  The supplemental pension due under Sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 to 
each participant described in subsection 7-1 shall be reduced as provided in 
subsections 5-3 and 5-6 of the Annuity Plan for each month by which its 
commencement date precedes the last day of the month in which the participant 
will attain age 60.  No reduction will be made for the period between the 
last day of the months the participant will attain age 60 and age 62.

    7-3.  Each participant described in subsection 7-1 shall receive a 
monthly supplemental pension under this Supplemental Plan equal to any 
reduction made in such participant's Annuity Plan pension under subsections 
5-3 or 5-6 of the Annuity

Plan for the period between the last day of the months the participant will 
attain age 60 and age 62.

                                      SECTION 8
                                    MISCELLANEOUS

    8-1. For purposes of this Supplemental Plan, the term "Management Incentive
Plan" shall mean the Abbott Laboratories 1971 Management Incentive Plan, the
Abbott Laboratories 1981 Management Incentive Plan and all successor plans to
those plans.

    8-2. The supplemental pension described in Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7
shall be paid to the participant or his or her beneficiary based on the
particular pension option elected by the participant, in the same manner, at the
same time, for the same period and on the same terms and conditions as the
pension payable to the participant or his beneficiary under the Annuity Plan.
In the event a participant is paid his or her pension under the Annuity Plan in
a lump sum, any supplemental pension due under Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 shall
likewise be paid in a lump sum.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provision of this
subsection 8-2: (a) if the present value of the vested supplemental pensions
described in Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of a participant who is actively
employed by Abbott as a corporate officer exceeds $100,000, then payment of such
pensions shall be made to the participant under Section 9 below; and (b) if the
monthly vested supplemental pensions, expressed as a straight life annuity, due
a participant or his or her beneficiary under Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 do
not exceed an aggregate of One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) as of the
commencement date of the pension payable such participant or his or her
beneficiary under the Annuity Plan, and payment of such supplemental pension has
not previously been made under Section

<PAGE>

                                         -10-

9, the present value of such supplemental pensions shall be paid such
participant or beneficiary in a lump-sum.

    8-3. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Supplemental Plan, if
employment of any participant with Abbott and its subsidiaries and affiliates
should terminate for any reason within five (5) years after the date of a Change
in Control:

    (a)  The present value of any supplemental pension due the participant
         under Section 2 (whether or not then payable) shall be paid to
         the participant in a lump sum within thirty (30) days following
         such termination; and

    (b)  The present value of any supplemental pension due the participant
         under Sections 3 or 4 (whether or not then payable) shall be paid
         to the participant in a lump sum within thirty (30) days
         following such termination.

The supplemental pension described in paragraph (a) shall be computed using as
the applicable limit under Section 415, Internal Revenue Code, such limit as is
in effect on the termination date and based on the assumption that the
participant will receive his or her Annuity Plan pension in the form of a
straight life annuity with no ancillary benefits.  The present values of the
supplemental pensions described in paragraphs (a) and (b) shall be computed as
of the date of payment by using an interest rate equal to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation interest rate applicable to an immediate annuity, as in
effect on the date of payment.

    8-4.  For purposes of subsection 8-3, a "Change in Control" shall be deemed
to have occurred on the earliest of the following dates:

    (a)  The date any entity or person (including a "group" as defined in
         Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
         "Exchange Act")) shall have become the beneficial owner of, or
         shall have obtained voting control over thirty percent (30%) or
         more of the outstanding common shares of the Company;

<PAGE>

                                         -11-

    (b)  The date the shareholders of the Company approve a definitive
         agreement (A) to merge or consolidate the Company with or into
         another corporation, in which the Company is not the continuing
         or surviving corporation or pursuant to which any common shares
         of the Company would be converted into cash, securities or other
         property of another corporation, other than a merger of the
         Company in which holders of common shares immediately prior to
         the merger have the same proportionate ownership of common
         stock of the surviving corporation immediately after the merger as
         immediately before, or (B) to sell or otherwise dispose of
         substantially all the assets of the Company; or

    (c)  The date there shall have been a change in a majority of the
         Board of Directors of the Company within a twelve (12) month
         period unless the nomination for election by the Company's
         shareholders of each new director was approved by the vote of
         two-thirds of the directors then still in office who were in
         office at the beginning of the twelve (12) month period.

    8-5.  The provisions of subsections 8-3, 8-4 and this subsection 8-5 may
not be amended or deleted, nor superseded by any other provision of this
Supplemental Plan, during the period beginning on the date of a Change in
Control and ending on the date five years following such Change in Control.

    8-6.  All benefits due under this Supplement Plan shall be paid by Abbott
and Abbott shall be reimbursed for such payments by the employee's employer.  In
the event the employee is employed by more than one employer, each employer
shall reimburse Abbott in proportion to the period of time the employee was
employed by such employer, as determined by the Board of Review in its sole
discretion.

    8-7.  The benefits under the Supplemental Plan are not in any way subject
to the debts or other obligations of the persons entitled to benefits and may
not be voluntarily or involuntarily sold, transferred to assigned.

<PAGE>

                                         -12-

    8-8.  Nothing contained in this Supplemental Plan shall confer on any
employee the right to be retained in the employ of Abbott or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates.

    8-9.  Upon adoption of this Supplemental Plan, the prior resolutions shall
be deemed rescinded.

                                      SECTION 9
                      ALTERNATE PAYMENT OF SUPPLEMENTAL PENSIONS

    9-1.  If, as of December 31, 1995 or any subsequent December 31, the
present value of the supplemental pension described in Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
and 7 of a participant, who is actively employed by Abbott as a corporate
officer, exceeds $100,000, then payment of such present value shall be made, at
the direction of the participant, by either of the following methods:  (a)
current payment in cash directly to the participant, or (b) current payment of a
portion of such present value (determined as of that December 31) in cash for
the participant directly to a Grantor Trust established by the participant, and
current payment of the balance of such present value in cash directly to the
participant, provided that the payment made directly to the participant shall
approximate the aggregate federal, state and local individual income taxes
attributable to the amount paid pursuant to this subparagraph 9-1(b) (as
determined pursuant to the tax rates set forth in subsection 9-14).

    9-2.  If the present value of a participant's supplemental pension has been
paid to the participant (including amounts paid to the participant's Grantor
Trust) pursuant to subsection 9-1 (either as in effect prior to June 1, 1996
that applied to any participant with a supplemental pension with a present value
in excess of $100,000 or as currently in effect that requires the participant to
have a supplemental pension with a present value in excess of $100,000 and to be
a corporate officer), then as of each

<PAGE>

                                         -13-

subsequent December 31, such participant shall be entitled to a payment in an
amount equal to:  (i) the present value (as of that December 31) of the
participant's supplemental pension described in Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7,
less (ii) the current value (as of that December 31) of the payments previously
made to the participant under subsections 9-1 and 9-2.  Payments under this
subsection 9-2 shall be made, at the direction of the participant, by either of
the following methods:  (a) current payment in cash directly to the participant,
or (b) current payment of a portion of such amount in cash for the participant
directly to the Grantor Trust established by the participant; and current
payment of the balance of such amount in cash directly to the participant,
provided that the payment made directly to the participant shall approximate the
aggregate federal, state and local individual income taxes attributable to the
amount paid pursuant to this subparagraph 9-2(b) (as determined pursuant to the
tax rates set forth in subsection 9-14).  No payments shall be made under this
subsection 9-2 as of any December 31 after the calendar year in which the
participant retires or otherwise terminates employment with Abbott.

    9-3.  Present values for the purposes of subsections 9-1, 9-2, 9-4 and 9-5
shall be determined using reasonable actuarial assumptions specified for this
purpose by Abbott and consistently applied.  The "current value" of the payments
previously made to a participant under subsections 9-1 and 9-2 means the
aggregate amount of such payments, with interest thereon (at the rate specified
for this purpose by Abbott).  For purposes of subsections 9-4 and 9-5,
"Projected Taxes" with respect to any payment of supplemental pension benefits
under subsections 9-1 or 9-2, shall mean the taxes which Abbott projects will be
incurred by the participant on the income earned (i) on the payment (net of
taxes) that is made pursuant to subsections 9-1 or 9-2, (ii) on the

<PAGE>

                                         -14-

corresponding payment(s) for Projected Taxes that are made pursuant to
subsection 9-4 and, if applicable, 9-5 and (iii) on the accumulated income
earned on any of the payments covered by parts (i) and (ii) hereof, during the
life of such participant's Grantor Trust (or during the period that such Grantor
Trust would have been in existence if the participant had elected to receive all
of the payments under subsections 9-1 and 9-2 in cash).  In calculating such
Projected Taxes, Abbott shall use the aggregate of the current federal, state
and local tax rates specified by subsection 9-14.

    9-4.  Effective as of December 31, 1995, or any subsequent December 31, as
a result of any payment made to a Qualified Participant for any calendar year
pursuant to subsection 9-1 or 9-2, Abbott shall also make a corresponding
payment to such Qualified Participant in the amount of the present value of the
Projected Taxes.  A "Qualified Participant" is either (i) a participant who as
of December 31, 1995 was actively employed by Abbott and who had previously
received, or as of such date was qualified to receive, a payment under
subsection 9-1; or (ii) a participant who as of any subsequent December 31
qualifies to receive a payment pursuant to subsection 9-1.  The payment for
Projected Taxes under this subsection 9-4 shall be made to the Qualified
Participant in the identical manner that the payment under subsection 9-1 or 9-2
was made.  For example, (a) if the Qualified Participant elected to receive the
payment under subsection 9-1 directly in cash, then Abbott shall also pay the
present value of the Projected Taxes on such payment in cash directly to the
Qualified Participant, and (b) if the Qualified Participant elected to receive
the payment under subsection 9-1 into a Grantor Trust established by the
Qualified Participant, then Abbott shall pay the present value of the Projected
Taxes on such payment as follows:

<PAGE>

                                         -15-

current payment of a portion of such present value (determined as of that
December 31) in cash for such Qualified Participant directly to a Grantor Trust
established by such participant, and current payment of the balance of such
present value in cash directly to such Qualified Participant, provided that the
payment made directly to such participant shall approximate the aggregate
federal, state and local individual income taxes attributable to the amount paid
pursuant to this subparagraph 9-4(b) (as determined pursuant to the tax rates
set forth in subsection 9-14).  No payments shall be made under this subsection
9-4 as of any December 31 after the calendar year in which the participant
retires or otherwise terminates employment with Abbott.

    9-5.  In the event that Abbott has made any payment for Projected Taxes
under subsection 9-4 in cash directly to the Qualified Participant and there is
a subsequent increase in the tax rates for such Qualified Participant, Abbott
shall make a further cash payment to such Qualified Participant in the amount of
(a) the present value of the Projected Taxes on the payments that were made
under subsections 9-1 and 9-2 in cash directly to such Qualified Participant
using the actual tax rates for previous years and the new tax rates (determined
in accordance with subsection 9-14) for the current and subsequent years, less
(b) the amount that would have been in the Qualified Participant's Tax Payment
Account with respect to the payments made under subsections 9-1 and 9-2 in cash
directly to the Participant, if such payments had instead been made to the
Qualified Participant's Grantor Trust.  Such amount shall be paid by Abbott
directly to the Qualified Participant in cash.  In the event that Abbott has
made any payment for Projected Taxes under subsection 9-4 to the Qualified
Participant's Grantor Trust, then Abbott shall as of December 31 of each year,
make a further payment to the Qualified Participant in the amount of (a) the
present value (as
<PAGE>


                                        - 16 -

of that December 31) of the Projected Taxes on the payments that were made under
subsections 9-1 and 9-2 into the Qualified Participant's Grantor Trust less (b)
the balance of such Qualified Participant's Tax Payment Account (as described in
subsection 9-8).  Such payment shall be paid by Abbott as follows:  the current
payment of a portion of such amount in cash directly to the Qualified
Participant's Grantor Trust and the current payment of the balance of such
amount in cash directly to such Qualified Participant; provided, that the
payments made directly to such Qualified Participant shall approximate the
aggregate federal, state and local individual income taxes attributable to the
amount paid pursuant to this subsection 9-5. No payments shall be made under
this subsection 9-5 for any year following the participant's death.  In the
event that the calculation required by this subsection 9-5 for a Grantor Trust
demonstrates that there has been an overpayment of projected taxes, such
overpayment shall be held within the Grantor Trust in an Excess Tax Account and
may be used by Abbott as a credit against any payments due hereunder or as
specified in subsection 9-12.

    9-6.  For each Qualified Participant whose Grantor Trust has received a 
payment pursuant to subsection 9-4, Abbott, as the administrator of such 
Grantor Trust, shall direct the trustee to distribute to the participant from 
the income of such Grantor Trust, a sum of money sufficient to pay the taxes 
on trust earnings for such year.  The taxes shall be calculated by 
multiplying the income of the Grantor Trust by the aggregate of the federal, 
state, and local tax rates (determined in accordance with subsection 9-14).

    9-7.  A participant shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived and shall be
foreclosed from any right to receive any supplemental pension benefits on that
portion

<PAGE>

                                        - 17 -

of the supplemental pension that the participant elects to be paid in cash under
subsection 9-1 or 9-2.  A participant, who has elected to receive a payment
under subsection 9-1 or 9-2 to a Grantor Trust, must establish such trust in a
form which Abbott determines to be substantially similar to the trust attached
to this Supplemental Plan as Exhibit A.  If a participant fails to make an
election under subsection 9-1 or 9-2, or if a participant makes an election
under subsection 9-1 or 9-2 to receive payment in a Grantor Trust but fails to
establish a Grantor Trust, then payment shall be made in cash directly to the
participant.   Each payment required under subsections 9-1, 9-2, 9-4 and 9-5
shall be made as soon as practicable after the amount thereof can be ascertained
by Abbott, but in no event later than the last day of the calendar year
following the December 31 as of which such payment becomes due. 

    9-8.  Abbott will establish and maintain a separate Supplemental Pension
Account in the name of each participant, a separate After-Tax Supplemental
Pension Account in the name of each participant, and a separate Tax Payment
Account in the name of each participant.  The Supplemental Pension Account shall
reflect any amounts:  (i)  paid to a participant (including amounts paid to a
participant's Grantor Trust) pursuant to subsections 9-1, and 9-2; (ii) credited
to such Account pursuant to subsection 9-9; and (iii) disbursed to a participant
for supplemental pension benefits (or which would have been disbursed to a
participant if the participant had not elected to receive a cash disbursement
pursuant to subsections 9-1 and 9-2).  The After-Tax Supplemental Pension
Account shall also reflect such amounts but shall be maintained on an after-tax
basis.  The Tax Payment Account shall reflect any amounts (i) paid to a
Qualified Participant (net of taxes) pursuant to subsections 9-4 and 9-5 and
(ii) disbursed to a participant for the payment of taxes pursuant to subsection
9-6.

<PAGE>


                                        - 18 -

The accounts established pursuant to this subsection 9-8 are for the convenience
of the administration of the Plan and no trust relationship with respect to such
accounts is intended or should be implied.

    9-9.  As of the end of each calendar year, a participant's Supplemental 
Pension Account shall be credited with interest calculated at a reasonable 
rate of interest specified for this purpose by Abbott and consistently 
applied.  Any amount so credited shall be referred to as a participant's 
"Interest Accrual". The calculation of the Interest Accrual shall be based on 
the balance of the payments made pursuant to subsections 9-1 and 9-2 and any 
Interest Accrual thereon from previous years.  As of the end of each calendar 
year a participant's After-Tax Supplemental Pension Account shall be credited 
with interest which shall be referred to as the After-Tax Interest Accrual.  
The "After-Tax Interest Accrual" shall be an amount equal to (a) the Interest 
Accrual credit to the participant's Supplemental Pension Account for such 
year less (b) the product of (i) the amount of such Interest Accrual 
multiplied by (ii) the aggregate of the federal, state and local income tax 
rates (determined in accordance with subsection 9-14).  The Excess Interest 
Account shall be the cumulative amount, if any, by which the net income 
earned by the Grantor Trust on the payments made pursuant to Sections 9-1, 
9-2, 9-4, 9-5 and 9-10 (and interest earned thereon) for all years that the 
Grantor Trust has been in existence exceeds the After-Tax Interest Accrual 
for such years.

    9-10.  In addition to any payment made to a participant for any calendar
year pursuant to subsections 9-1, 9-2, 9-4 and 9-5, Abbott shall also make a
payment to a participant's Grantor Trust (a "Guaranteed Rate Payment"), for any
year in which the net income of such trust does not equal or exceed the
participant's After-Tax Interest Accrual for that year.  The Guaranteed Rate
Payment shall equal the difference

<PAGE>

                                        - 19 -

between the participant's After-Tax Interest Accrual and such net income of the
participant's Grantor Trust for the year, and shall be paid within 180 days of
the end of that year.  Any funds in a participant's Excess Interest Account may
be used by Abbott as a credit against any Guaranteed Rate Payment due to the
participant under this subsection 9-10 or as specified in subsection 9-12.  No
payments shall be made under this subsection 9-10 for any year following the
year of the participant's death.

    9-11.  If at any time after a participant's retirement or other termination
of employment with Abbott, there is no longer a balance in his or her Grantor
Trust, then such participant (or his or her surviving spouse if such spouse is
entitled to periodic payments from the Grantor Trust) shall be entitled to a
"Continuation Payment" under this subsection 9-11.  The amount of the
Continuation Payment shall be equal to the amount of the supplemental pension
that would have been payable to the participant (or surviving spouse) had no
payments been made to or for the participant's Grantor Trust under subsections
9-1 and 9-2.  Continuation Payments shall be made monthly, beginning with the
month in which there is no longer a sufficient balance in the participant's
Grantor Trust and ending with the month of the participant's (or surviving
spouse's) death.  Payments under this subsection 9-11 shall be made by the
employers (in such proportions as Abbott shall designate) directly from their
general corporate assets.  Appropriate adjustments to the Continuation Payments
shall be made in the event distributions have been made from a participant's
Grantor Trust for reasons other than benefit payments to the participant or
surviving spouse.

    9-12.  To the extent that Abbott is obligated to make a payment to a
participant under subsections 9-1, 9-2, 9-4, 9-5 or 9-10, Abbott shall have the
right to offset such payment with any funds in the participant's Excess Interest
Account or Excess Tax

<PAGE>


                                        - 20 -

Account.  In addition, any funds in a participant's Excess Tax Account may be
used by Abbott as a credit against any future Guaranteed Rate Payment due to the
participant under subsection 9-10.

    9-13.  For participants who are not Qualified Participants that received
any payment pursuant to subsection 9-4, in addition to the payments provided
under subsections 9-1 and 9-2, each participant shall also be entitled to a Tax
Gross Up payment for each year there is a balance in his or her Supplemental
Pension Account.  The "Tax Gross Up" shall approximate:  (a) the product of (i)
the participant's After-Tax Interest Accrual for the year (calculated using the
greater of the rate of return of the Grantor Trusts or the rate specified in
subsection 9-9), multiplied by (ii) the aggregate of the federal, state and
local tax rates (determined in accordance with subsection 9-14) plus (b) an
amount equal to the product of (i) any payment made pursuant to this subsection
9-13, multiplied by (ii) the aggregate tax rate determined under subparagraph
9-13(a)(ii) above, such that the participant is fully compensated for taxes on
payments made hereunder.  Payment of the Tax Gross Up shall be made by the
employers (in such proportions as Abbott shall designate) directly from their
general corporate assets.  The Tax Gross Up for a year shall be paid to the
participant as soon as practicable after the amount of the Tax Gross Up can be
ascertained by Abbott, but in no event later than the last day of the calendar
year following the calendar year to which the Tax Gross Up relates.  No payments
shall be made under this subsection 9-13 for any year following the year of the
participant's death.

    9-14.  For purposes of this Supplemental Plan, a participant's federal
income tax rate shall be deemed to be the highest marginal rate of federal
individual income tax in effect in the calendar year in which a calculation
under this Supplemental Plan

<PAGE>

                                        - 21 -

is to be made, and state and local tax rates shall be deemed to be the highest
marginal rates of individual income tax in effect in the state and locality of
the participant's residence in the calendar year for which such a calculation is
to be made, net of any federal tax benefits.

may be referred to as the "                                                 
                          ------------------------------------------------
Supplemental Benefit Grantor Trust."

    I-2.  THE TRUST FUND.  The "trust fund" as at any date means all property
then held by the trustee under this agreement.

    I-3.  STATUS OF THE TRUST.  The trust shall be irrevocable.  The trust is

    I-4.  THE ADMINISTRATOR.  Abbott Laboratories ("Abbott") shall act as the
"administrator" of the trust, and as such shall have certain powers, rights and
duties under this agreement as described below.  Abbott will certify to the

                                      ARTICLE II
                            DISTRIBUTION OF THE TRUST FUND

     II-1.  SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION ACCOUNT.  The administrator shall maintain a
"supplemental pension account" under the trust. As of the end of each calendar
year, the administrator shall charge the account with all distributions made
from the account during that year; and credit the account with its share of
trust income and realized gains and charge the account with its share of trust
expenses and realized losses for the year.

     II-2.  DISTRIBUTIONS PRIOR TO THE GRANTOR'S DEATH. Principal and
accumulated income shall not be distributed from the trust prior to the
grantor's retirement or other termination of employment with Abbott or a
subsidiary of Abbott (the grantor's "settlement date"); provided that, each year
the administrator may direct the trustee to distribute to the grantor a portion
of the income of the trust fund for that year, with the balance of such income
to be accumulated in the trust.  The administrator shall inform the trustee of
the grantor's settlement date.  Thereafter, the trustee shall distribute the
amounts from time to time credited to the supplemental pension account to the
grantor, if then living, in the same manner, at the same time and over the same
period as the pension payable to the grantor under Abbott Laboratories Annuity
Retirement Plan.

     II-3.  DISTRIBUTIONS AFTER THE GRANTOR'S DEATH.  The grantor, from time to
time may name any person or persons (who may be named contingently or
successively and who may be natural persons or fiduciaries) to whom the
principal of the trust fund and all accrued or undistributed income thereof
shall be distributed upon the grantor's death.  The grantor may direct that such
amounts be distributed in a lump-sum or, if the beneficiary is the grantor's
spouse (or a trust for which the grantor's spouse is the sole income
beneficiary), in the same manner, at the same time and over the same period as
the pension payable to the grantor's surviving spouse under the Abbott
Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan.  If the grantor directs the same method of
distribution as the pension payable to the surviving spouse under the Abbott
Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan, any amounts remaining at the death of the
spouse beneficiary shall be distributed in a lump sum to the executor or
administrator of the spouse beneficiary's estate.  Each designation shall revoke
all prior designations, shall be in writing and shall be effective only when
filed by the grantor with the administrator during the grantor's lifetime.  If
the grantor fails to direct a method of distribution, the distribution shall be
made in a lump sum.  If the grantor fails to designate a beneficiary as provided
above, then on the grantor's death, the trustee shall distribute the balance of
the trust fund in a lump sum to the executor or administrator of the grantor's
estate.

     II-4.  FACILITY OF PAYMENT.  When a person entitled to a distribution
hereunder is under legal disability, or, in the trustee's opinion, is in any way
incapacitated so as to be unable to manage his or her financial affairs, the
trustee may make such distribution to such person's legal representative, or to
a relative or friend of such person for such person's benefit.  Any distribution
made in accordance with the


<PAGE>

                                        - 3 -


preceding sentence shall be a full and complete discharge of any liability for
such distribution hereunder.

     II-5.  PERPETUITIES.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
agreement, on the day next preceding the end of 21 years after the death of the
last to die of the grantor and the grantor's descendants living on the date of
this instrument, the trustee shall immediately distribute any remaining balance
in the trust to the beneficiaries then entitled to distributions hereunder.


                                     ARTICLE III
                             MANAGEMENT OF THE TRUST FUND

    III-1.  GENERAL POWERS.  The trustee shall, with respect to the trust fund,
have the following powers, rights and duties in addition to those provided
elsewhere in this agreement or by law:

            (a)  Subject to the limitations of subparagraph (b) next below, to
                 sell, contract to sell, purchase, grant or exercise options to
                 purchase, and otherwise deal with all assets of the trust
                 fund, in such way, for such considerations, and on such terms
                 and conditions as the trustee decides.

            (b)  To invest and reinvest the trust fund, without distinction
                 between principal and income, in obligations of the United
                 States Government and its agencies or which are backed by the
                 full faith and credit of the United States Government and in
                 any mutual funds, common trust funds or collective investment
                 funds which invest solely in such obligations, provided that
                 to the extent practicable no more than Ten Thousand Dollars
                 ($10,000) shall be invested in such mutual funds, common trust
                 funds or collective investment funds at any time; and any such
                 investment made or retained by the trustee in good faith shall
                 be proper despite any resulting risk or lack of
                 diversification or marketability.

            (c)  To deposit cash in any depositary (including the banking
                 department of the bank acting as trustee) without liability
                 for interest, in amounts not in excess of those reasonably
                 necessary to make distributions from the trust.

            (d)  To borrow from anyone, with the administrator's approval, such
                 sum or sums from time to time as the trustee considers
                 desirable to carry out this trust, and to mortgage or pledge
                 all or part of the trust fund as security.

            (e)  To retain any funds or property subject to any dispute without
                 liability for interest and to decline to make payment or
                 delivery

                 jurisdiction or until an appropriate release is obtained.

            (f)  To begin, maintain or defend any litigation necessary in
                 connection with the administration of this trust, except that
                 the trustee shall not be obliged or required to do so unless
                 indemnified to the trustee's satisfaction.

            (g)  To compromise, contest, settle or abandon claims or demands.

            (h)  To give proxies to vote stocks and other voting securities, to

                 trusts, mergers, consolidations, foreclosures,
                 reorganizations, liquidations, or other changes in the
                 financial structure of any corporation, and to exercise or
                 sell stock subscription or conversion rights.

            (i)  To hold securities or other property in the name of a nominee,
                 in a depositary, or in any other way, with or without
                 disclosing the trust relationship.

            (j)  To divide or distribute the trust fund in undivided interests
                 or wholly or partly in kind.

            (k)  To pay any tax imposed on or with respect to the trust; to
                 defer making payment of any such tax if it is indemnified to
                 its satisfaction in the premises; and to require before making
                 any payment such release or other document from any lawful
                 taxing authority and such indemnity from the intended payee as
                 the trustee considers necessary for its protection.

            (l)  To deal without restriction with the legal representative of
                 the grantor's estate or the trustee or other legal
                 representative of any trust created by the grantor or a trust
                 or estate in which a beneficiary has an interest, even though
                 the trustee, individually, shall be acting in such other
                 capacity, without liability for any loss that may result.

            (m)  Upon the prior written consent of the administrator, to
                 appoint or remove by written instrument any bank or
                 corporation qualified to act as successor trustee, wherever
                 located, as special trustee as to part or all of the trust
                 fund, including property as to which the trustee does not act,
                 and such special trustee, except as specifically limited or
                 provided by this or the appointing instrument, shall have all
                 of the rights, titles, powers, duties, discretions and
                 immunities of the trustee, without liability for any action
                 taken or omitted to be taken under this or the appointing
                 instrument.

            (n)  To appoint or remove by written instrument any bank, wherever
                 located, as custodian of part or all of the trust fund, and
                 each such custodian shall have such rights, powers, duties and
                 discretions as are delegated to it by the trustee.

            (o)  To employ agents, attorneys, accountants or other persons, and
                 to delegate to them such powers as the trustee considers
                 desirable, and the trustee shall be protected in acting or
                 refraining from acting on the advice of persons so employed
                 without court action.

            (p)  To perform any and all other acts which in the trustee's
                 judgment are appropriate for the proper management, investment
                 and distribution of the trust fund.

    III-2.  PRINCIPAL AND INCOME.  Any income earned on the trust fund which is
not distributed as provided in Article II shall be accumulated and from time to
time added to the principal of the trust.  The grantor's interest in the trust

including principal and accumulated income.

    III-3.  STATEMENTS.  The trustee shall prepare and deliver monthly to the
administrator and annually to the grantor, if then living, otherwise to each
beneficiary then entitled to distributions under this agreement, a statement (or
series of statements) setting forth (or which taken together set forth) all
investments, receipts, disbursements and other transactions effected by the
trustee during the reporting period; and showing the trust fund and the value
thereof at the end of such period.

    III-4.  COMPENSATION AND EXPENSES.  All reasonable costs, charges and
expenses incurred in the administration of this trust, including compensation to
the trustee, any compensation to agents, attorneys, accountants and other

                                      ARTICLE IV

     IV-1.  INTERESTS NOT TRANSFERABLE.  The interests of the grantor or other
persons entitled to distributions hereunder are not subject to their debts or
other obligations and may not be voluntarily or involuntarily sold, transferred,
alienated, assigned or encumbered.

     IV-2.  DISAGREEMENT AS TO ACTS.  If there is a disagreement between the
trustee and anyone as to any act or transaction reported in any accounting, the
trustee shall have the right to a settlement of its account by any proper court.

                                        - 6 -


     IV-3.  TRUSTEE'S OBLIGATIONS.  No power, duty or responsibility is imposed
on the trustee except as set forth in this agreement.  The trustee is not
obliged to determine whether funds delivered to or distributions from the trust
are proper under the trust, or whether any tax is due or payable as a result of
any such delivery or distribution.  The trustee shall be protected in making any
distribution from the trust as directed pursuant to Article II without inquiring
as to whether the distributee is entitled thereto; the trustee shall not be
liable for any distribution made in good faith without written notice or
knowledge that the distribution is not proper under the terms of this agreement;
and the trustee shall not be liable for any action taken because of the specific
direction of the administrator.

     IV-4.  GOOD FAITH ACTIONS.  The trustee's exercise or non-exercise of its
powers and discretions in good faith shall be conclusive on all persons.  No one
shall be obliged to see to the application of any money paid or property
delivered to the trustee.  The certificate of the trustee that it is acting
according to this agreement will fully protect all persons dealing with the
trustee.

     IV-5.  WAIVER OF NOTICE.  Any notice required under this agreement may be
waived by the person entitled to such notice.

     IV-6.  CONTROLLING LAW.  The laws of the State of Illinois shall govern
the interpretation and validity of the provisions of this agreement and all
questions relating to the management, administration, investment and
distribution of the trust hereby created.

     IV-7.  SUCCESSORS.  This agreement shall be binding on all persons
entitled to distributions hereunder and their respective heirs and legal
representatives, and on the trustee and its successors.


                                      ARTICLE V
                                  CHANGES IN TRUSTEE

      V-1.  RESIGNATION OR REMOVAL OF TRUSTEE.  The trustee may resign at any
time by giving thirty days' advance written notice to the administrator and the
grantor.  The administrator may remove a trustee by written notice to the
trustee and the grantor.

      V-2.  APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE.  The administrator shall fill any
vacancy in the office of trustee as soon as practicable by written notice to the
successor trustee; and shall give prompt written notice thereof to the grantor,
if then living, otherwise to each beneficiary then entitled to payments or
distributions under this agreement.  A successor trustee shall be a bank (as
defined in Section 581 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended).

                                        - 7 -


      V-3.  DUTIES OF RESIGNING OR REMOVED TRUSTEE AND OF SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE.  A
trustee that resigns or is removed shall furnish promptly to the administrator
and the successor trustee an account of its administration of the trust from the
date of its last account.  Each successor trustee shall succeed to the title to
the trust fund vested in its predecessor without the signing or filing of any
instrument, but each predecessor trustee shall execute all documents and do all
acts necessary to vest such title of record in the successor trustee.  Each
successor trustee shall have all the powers conferred by this agreement as if
originally named trustee.  No successor trustee shall be personally liable for
any act or failure to act of a predecessor trustee.  With the approval of the
administrator, a successor trustee may accept the account furnished and the
property delivered by a predecessor trustee without incurring any liability for
so doing, and such acceptance will be complete discharge to the predecessor
trustee.


                                      ARTICLE VI
                              AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

     VI-1.  AMENDMENT.  With the consent of the administrator, this trust may
be amended from time to time by the grantor, if then living, otherwise by a
majority of the beneficiaries then entitled to payments or distributions
hereunder, except as follows:

            (a)  The duties and liabilities of the trustee cannot be changed
                 substantially without its consent.

            (b)  This trust may not be amended so as to make the trust
                 revocable.

     VI-2.  TERMINATION.  This trust shall not terminate, and all rights,
titles, powers, duties, discretions and immunities imposed on or reserved to the
trustee, the administrator, the grantor and the beneficiaries shall continue in
effect, until all assets of the trust have been distributed by the trustee as
provided in Article II.

                                    *     *     *

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the grantor and the trustee have executed this agreement as
of the day and year first above written.

NOTE:    For the purpose of calculating this ratio, (i) earnings have been
         calculated by adjusting net earnings for taxes on earnings; interest
         expense; capitalized interest cost, net of amortization; minority
         interest; and the portion of rentals representative of the interest
         factor, (ii) the Company considers one-third of rental expense to be
         the amount representing return on capital, and (iii) fixed charges
         comprise total interest expense, including capitalized interest and
         such portion of rentals.
