              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                 MARCH 31, 1994

                                   (UNAUDITED)


NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PREPARATION:

The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and footnote
disclosures normally included in audited financial statements.  However, in the
opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments)
necessary to present fairly the financial position, cash flows, and results of
operations have been made.  It is suggested that these statements be read in
conjunction with the financial statements included in the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993.


NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE:

Earnings per common share amounts are computed by using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding.  These shares averaged 818,988,000 for the
three months ended March 31, 1994 and 834,693,000 for the same period in 1993.


NOTE 3 - TAXES ON EARNINGS:

Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective tax rates.  The
effective tax rates are less than the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate
principally due to tax incentive grants related to subsidiaries operating in
Puerto Rico and Ireland.  The increase in the effective tax rate from 28 percent
in 1993 to 30 percent in 1994 is due primarily to the increase in the statutory
U.S. federal income tax rate and the reduction in the tax incentive grants for
operations in Puerto Rico.

(Unaudited), Continued


NOTE 4 - LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:

The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings including
numerous antitrust suits and investigations in connection with the sale and
marketing of infant formula and pharmaceutical products.

The Company is also involved in numerous product liability cases, many of which
allege injuries to the offspring of women who ingested a synthetic estrogen
(DES) during pregnancy.  In addition, the Company has been identified as a
potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of
locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal remediation laws
and is voluntarily investigating potential contamination at a number of
Company-owned locations.

The matters above are discussed more fully in Item 1, Business - Environmental
Matters, and Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, which
is available upon request, and in Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings, in this
Form.

While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending claims,
proceedings, investigations and remediation activities with certainty,
management is of the opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.

FINANCIAL REVIEW


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FIRST QUARTER 1994 COMPARED WITH FIRST QUARTER 1993

Worldwide sales for the first quarter increased 8.3 percent to $2.215 billion
from $2.046 billion in 1993.  Net earnings and earnings per share increased
6.0 percent and 9.8 percent, respectively, over the prior year quarter.

Gross profit margin (sales less cost of products sold, including freight and
distribution expenses) of 56.5 percent for the first quarter was up from
54.4 percent a year ago.  This increase was primarily due to product mix and
continued productivity improvements.

Research and development expenses increased to $226.8 million in the first
quarter 1994.  This represented 10.2 percent of net sales, compared to
9.9 percent in 1993.  The majority of research and development expenditures
continues to be concentrated on pharmaceutical and diagnostic products.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7.0 percent over the
comparable 1993 quarter.  The increase reflects additional selling and marketing
support for new and existing products, primarily for pharmaceutical and
nutritional products, and litigation expenses.

Other (income) expense, net, includes exchange losses of $12.2 million in the
1994 first quarter, compared with net losses of $4.3 million in the same quarter
last year.  Also included in the 1993 first quarter is the gain on the sale of
the Company's peritoneal dialysis product line.

The effective income tax rate increased from 28 percent in 1993 to 30 percent in
1994 due primarily to the increase in the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate
and the reduction in tax incentive grants for Puerto Rico operations.

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

Industry segment sales for the first quarter 1994 and the related change from
the comparable 1993 period are shown in the table below.  The Pharmaceutical and
Nutritional Products segment includes a broad line of adult and pediatric
pharmaceuticals and nutritionals, which are sold primarily on the prescription
or recommendation of physicians or other health care professionals; consumer
products; agricultural and chemical products; and bulk pharmaceuticals.  The
Hospital and Laboratory Products segment includes diagnostic systems for blood
banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories and alternate-care testing sites;
intravenous and irrigation fluids and related administration equipment; drugs
and drug delivery systems; anesthetics; critical care products; and other
medical specialty products for hospitals and alternate-care sites.

Domestic and international sales for the first quarter reflect unit growth, and
international sales were adversely affected 4.3 percent due to the relatively
stronger U.S. dollar.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AT MARCH 31, 1994
COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 1993

Net cash from operating activities for the first quarter 1994 totaled
$547 million.  The Company expects annual cash flow from operating activities to
continue to approximate or exceed the Company's capital expenditures and cash
dividends.

The Company has maintained its favorable bond ratings (AAA by Standard & Poor's
Corporation and Aa1 by Moody's Investors Service) and continues to have readily
available financial resources, including unused domestic lines of credit of
$300 million at March 31, 1994.

During the first quarter 1994, the Company continued its program to purchase its
common shares.  The Company purchased and retired 5,355,000 shares during this
period at a cost of $154 million.  As of March 31, 1994, an additional 8,746,000
shares may be purchased in future periods under authorization granted by the
Board of Directors in September 1993.


LEGISLATIVE ISSUES

The Company's primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial
government regulation.  In the U.S., comprehensive legislation may be enacted
that could make significant changes to the availability, delivery and payment
for health care products and services.  International operations are also
subject to a significant degree of government regulation.  It is not possible to
predict the extent to which the Company or the health care industry in general
might be adversely affected by these factors in the future.  A more complete
discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, in the Annual
Report on Form 10-K, which is available upon request.

                         PART II.      OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

          The Company's 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1993
described 7 antitrust suits and 6 investigations (as of January 31, 1994)
regarding the Company's marketing and sale of infant formula products.  Five new
antitrust suits regarding the Company's marketing and sale of infant formula
products have commenced since January 31, 1994:  on February 11, 1994, a case
was filed in the District Court of Harrison County, Texas; on March 2, 1994, a
case was filed in the Circuit Court for Okaloosa County, Florida; on March 2,
1994, a case was filed in the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin (the
defendants have removed this case to federal court in Milwaukee); on March 9,
1994, a case was filed in the Circuit Court for the County of Calhoun, Michigan;
and on March 10, 1994, a case was filed in the Eighteenth Judicial District
court for Sedgwick County, Kansas.  Each purports to be a state consumer class
action; alleges violation of state antitrust and trade practices laws; asks for
unspecified actual and punitive damages, injunctive relief, and declaratory
judgment; and names the Company and certain other infant formula manufacturers
as defendants.  In addition, a purported class action filed on behalf Texas
consumers, which had been originally brought as a part of a case filed by the
State of Texas and which had been severed for appeal of the defendants'
successful motion for summary judgment, has been reinstated as a separate case,
SEGURA V. ABBOTT LABORATORIES, ET. AL., and is now pending in state court in
Travis County, Texas.  The Company intends to defend itself in these suits and
to deny all substantive allegations.  As of March 31, 1994 there are 13
antitrust suits and 6 investigations pending in connection with the Company's
sale and marketing of infant formula products.

          The Company's 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1993
described 22 antitrust suits (as of January 31, 1994) regarding the Company's
sale of prescription pharmaceuticals.  Additional lawsuits were filed in various
federal courts after January 31, 1994.  On February 4, 1994 all pending federal
cases were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Illinois under Multidistrict Litigation rules.  All of the federal
class action cases, except for BACON-NORMANDI V. ABBOTT LABORATORIES, ET AL.,
were withdrawn and refiled on March 7, 1994 in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Illinois as a single purported class action known
as HJB, ET AL. V. ABBOTT LABORATORIES, ET AL..  Plaintiffs seek unspecified
treble damages, attorneys' fees, and declaratory and injunctive relief.  As of
March 31, 1994, there are 16 antitrust suits pending in connection with the
Company's sale of prescription pharmaceuticals.  The Company intends to defend
itself in these suits and to deny all substantive allegations.

          On February 23, 1994, the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (the "EPA") instituted a civil administrative proceeding by filing a
complaint alleging that the Company burned hazardous waste at its North Chicago
facility in violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA").
The complaint seeks penalties of $991,775.  The EPA simultaneously issued an
Administrative Order requiring the Company to take certain actions to ensure
future compliance with the RCRA.  The Company filed an answer to the complaint
denying all substantive allegations.

</TABLE>

The preferences, qualifications, limitations, restrictions and the special or
relative rights in respect of the shares of each class are:

SECTION A

The Preferred Shares

1.   The Preferred Shares may be issued in one or more series and with such
designation for each such series sufficient to distinguish the shares thereof
from the shares of all other series and classes, as shall be stated and
expressed in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of each such
series adopted by the Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors in any such
resolution or resolutions is hereby expressly authorized to divide the Preferred
Shares into series and to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences
of the shares of any series so established as to:

     (i)       The rate per annum at which the holders of shares shall be
               entitled to receive dividends.

     (ii)      The price at and the terms and conditions on which shares may be
               redeemed.

     (iii)     The amount payable upon shares in event of involuntary
               liquidation.

     (iv)      The amount payable upon shares in event of voluntary liquidation.

     (v)       The sinking fund provisions, if any, for the redemption or
               purchase of shares.

     (vi)      The terms and conditions on which shares may be converted, if the
               shares are issued with the privilege of conversion.

The Board of Directors may increase the number of shares designated for any
existing series by a resolution adding to such



                                        4

<PAGE>

series authorized and unissued Preferred Shares not designated for any other
series.

2.   All preferred Shares of any one series shall be identical with each other
in all respects, except that shares of any one series issued at different times
as provided in paragraph 3 of this Section A, may differ as to the dates from
which dividends thereon shall be cumulative.

3.   Before any dividends on the Common Shares or on any other class or classes
of shares of the Corporation, ranking junior to the Preferred Shares with
respect to payment of dividends, shall be paid or declared or set apart for
payment, the holders of Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive when and
as declared by the Board of Directors, cumulative cash dividends, out of any
funds legally available for the declaration of dividends and in the case of each
series at the rate per annum, and no more, for the particular series fixed in
the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such series of
Preferred Shares, adopted by the Board of Directors, payable quarterly on such
dates, in each year, as may be fixed in such resolution or resolutions.  With
respect to each series of the Preferred Shares, such dividends shall be
cumulative from the respective dates of issue thereof. No dividends shall be
paid on any series of the Preferred Shares in respect of any dividend period
unless all cumulative dividends accrued prior to said dividend period with
respect to all Preferred Shares of each other series shall have been paid or
declared and set aside for payment.

4.   The holders of Preferred Shares shall be entitled to vote as a class and
otherwise as provided by law.

5.   Preferred shares which have been redeemed or shall have been purchased,
converted or otherwise acquired by the Corporation may thereafter be reissued
under such terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of this
Section A, as the Board of Directors may thereafter determine.

6.   In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, and before any distribution of the assets of the
Corporation shall be made to or set apart for the holders of the Common Shares
or of any other class of shares of the Corporation ranking junior to the
Preferred Shares with respect to payment of dividends or upon dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of the shares of each
series of the Preferred Shares then outstanding shall be entitled to receive
payment of such amount, as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or
resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issue of such
series; but such holders upon receipt of such payment shall be entitled to no
further payment.



                                        5

<PAGE>

7.   In case of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation,
if the amounts payable with respect to all series of Preferred Shares then
outstanding are not paid in full, the shares of all series of the Preferred
Shares shall share proportionately in accordance with the respective amounts
which would be payable on said shares if all amounts payable were paid in full.

8.   A consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into one or more
corporations shall not be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up
within the meaning of this Section A.

SECTION B

The Common Shares

1.   Subject to the limitations set forth in Section A of this Restated Article
R-V, the holders of Common Shares shall be entitled to dividends if, when and as
the same shall be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds of the
Corporation legally available thereof.

2.   The holders of Common Shares shall be entitled to vote as provided by law.

SECTION C

The Preferred and Common Shares

No holder of shares of any class of the Corporation shall be entitled as of
right to subscribe to or purchase any additional or increased shares of any
class (whether now or hereafter authorized), or obligations convertible into any
class or classes of shares (whether now or hereafter authorized), or shares of
any class convertible into shares of any other class or classes (whether now or
hereafter authorized), or obligations, shares or other securities carrying
warrants or rights to subscribe to shares of the Corporation of any class or
classes (whether now or hereafter authorized), but any and all shares, bonds,
debentures or other securities or obligations, whether or not convertible into
shares or carrying warrants entitling the holders thereof to subscribe to
shares, may be issued, sold or disposed of from time to time by the board of
Directors to such persons, firms or corporations and for such consideration (so
far as may be permitted by law, by the Articles of Incorporation of the
Corporation, and by the terms of any resolution creating any series of Preferred
Shares) as the Board of Directors shall from time to time in its absolute
discretion determine. Among other things the Board of Directors shall have the
right at any time and from time to time to offer, sell and issue shares of any
class of the Corporation, or obligations, shares or other securities



                                        6

<PAGE>

carrying warrants or rights to subscribe to shares of the Corporation of any
class or classes, to employees of the Corporation and to employees of
subsidiaries of the Corporation without first offering the same to its share
holders, for such prices or considerations, and upon such terms and conditions
as the Board of Directors shall from time to time determine, and upon any such
issuance and sale, or plan or proposal to issue and sell, the Board of Directors
may classify employees as in its discretion it may deem advisable, and may
differentiate between classes, and exclude any class from participation.  The
fact that an employee may be a director or an officer of the Corporation, or any
of its subsidiaries, shall not disqualify him from participation as an employee
in any such issuance or sale to employees.



RESTATED ARTICLE R-VI

1.   A director of the corporation shall not be personally liable to the
     corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of
     fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach
     of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its
     shareholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or that
     involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii)
     under Section 8.65 of the Illinois Business Corporation Act, or (iv)
     for any transaction from which the director derived an improper
     personal benefit; provided that the foregoing provision shall not
     eliminate or limit the liability of a director for any act or omission
     occurring before the date this provision became effective.

2.   Any person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party
     to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,
     whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of
     the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or
     agent of the corporation, or who is or was serving at the request of
     the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
     corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
     shall, in the case of persons who are or were directors or officers of

     directors or officers of the corporation, and may, as to such other
     persons, advance expenses incurred in defending such actions, suits or

     shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those
     seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled
     under any bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested
     directors or otherwise.

     NOTE:          For the purpose of calculating this ratio, (i) earnings have
                    been calculated by adjusting net earnings for taxes on
                    earnings; interest expense; capitalized interest cost, net
                    of amortization; minority interest; and the portion of
                    rentals representative of the interest factor, (ii) the
                    Company considers one-third of rental expense to be the
                    amount representing return on capital, and (iii) fixed
                    charges comprise total interest expense, including
                    capitalized interest and such portion of rentals.
