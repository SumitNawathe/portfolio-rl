                                   (UNAUDITED)



NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PREPARATION:


The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and, therefore, do not
include all information and footnote disclosures normally
included in audited financial statements.  However, in the
opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only
normal adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial
position, cash flows, and results of operations have been made.
It is suggested that these statements be read in conjunction
with the financial statements included in the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1994.


NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE:


Earnings per common share amounts are computed by using the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  These
shares averaged 799,246,000 for the six months ended June 30,
1995 and 816,763,000 for the same period in 1994.



NOTE 3 - TAXES ON EARNINGS:


Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective tax
rates.  The effective tax rates are less than the statutory U.S.
Federal income tax rate principally due to tax incentive grants
related to subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico, the Dominican
Republic, Italy, the Netherlands, and Ireland.

NOTE 4 - LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:

The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings
including numerous antitrust suits and investigations in
connection with the sale and marketing of infant formula
products and the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals.

In addition, the Company has been identified as a potentially
responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a
number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under
Federal remediation laws and is voluntarily investigating
potential contamination at a number of Company-owned locations.

The matters above are discussed more fully in Item 1, Business -
Environmental Matters, and Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in the
Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is available upon request, and
in Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings, in this Form.

While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending
claims, proceedings, investigations and remediation activities
with certainty, management is of the opinion that their ultimate
disposition should not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial position, cash flows, or results of
operations.

FINANCIAL REVIEW


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS 1995
COMPARED WITH SAME PERIODS IN 1994

Worldwide sales for the second quarter and first six months
increased 13.4 percent and 13.7 percent, respectively, over the
comparable 1994 periods.  Net earnings increased 12.6 percent
and 13.3 percent, respectively, in the second quarter and first
six months 1995.  Earnings per share increased 15.2 percent and
15.4 percent, respectively, in the second quarter and first six
months 1995.

Gross profit margin (sales less cost of products sold, including freight and
distribution expenses) was 56.6 percent for the 1995 second quarter, compared
to 57.0 percent for the 1994 second quarter.  First half gross margin was
56.7 percent, compared to 56.8 percent a year earlier.  The lower gross
profit margins are due to higher project expenses for new products, higher
manufacturing capacity costs for anticipated unit growth, and the effects of
inflation; partially offset by favorable product mix, especially higher sales
of pharmaceuticals, and productivity improvements.

Research and development expenses were $287.4 million and $534.5
million for the second quarter and first six months 1995,
respectively.  This represented 11.5 percent and 10.6 percent of
net sales, compared to 11.1 percent and 10.7 percent in 1994.
The majority of research and development expenditures continues
to be concentrated on pharmaceutical and diagnostic products.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter and
first six months 1995 increased 13.6 percent and 17.1 percent, respectively,
over the comparable prior year periods, including the adverse effects of the
relatively weaker dollar of 3.7 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively.
Selling, general and administrative expenses also increased as a result of
additional selling and marketing support for new and existing products,
primarily in the pharmaceutical and nutritional segment, and reflect
contributions to the Company's charitable foundation. The six month results
reflect charges against earnings for certain settled and pending litigation.

Other (income) expense, net, includes net foreign exchange
losses of $7.1 million and $15.5 million, respectively, for the
second quarter and first six months 1995 compared with net
foreign exchange losses of $15.3 million and $27.5 million for
the corresponding prior year periods.

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

Industry segment sales for the second quarter and first six
months 1995 and the related change from the comparable 1994
periods are shown in the table below.  The Pharmaceutical and
Nutritional Products segment includes a broad line of adult and
pediatric pharmaceuticals and nutritionals, which are sold
primarily on the prescription or recommendation of physicians or
other health care professionals; consumer products; agricultural
and chemical products; and bulk pharmaceuticals.  The Hospital
and Laboratory Products segment includes diagnostic systems for
blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories and
alternate-care testing sites; intravenous and irrigation fluids
and related administration equipment; drugs and drug delivery
systems; anesthetics; critical care products; and other medical
specialty products for hospitals and alternate-care sites.

Domestic and international sales for the second quarter and
first six months 1995 primarily reflect unit growth.
International sales were favorably affected 7.8 percent by the
relatively weaker dollar in the second quarter.  On a year-to-
date basis, international sales were favorably affected 6.4
percent by the relatively weaker U.S. dollar.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AT JUNE 30, 1995
COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 1994
------------------------------------------------


Net cash from operating activities for the first six months 1995
totaled $1.035 billion.  The Company expects annual cash flow
from operating activities to continue to approximate or exceed
the Company's capital expenditures and cash dividends.


The Company has maintained its favorable bond ratings (AAA by
Standard & Poor's Corporation and Aa1 by Moody's Investors
Service) and continues to have readily available financial
resources, including unused domestic lines of credit of $400
million at June 30, 1995.  These lines of credit support
domestic commercial paper borrowing arrangements.

During the first six months 1995, the Company continued its
program to purchase its common shares.  The Company purchased
and retired 10,710,000 shares during this period at a cost of
$396 million.  As of June 30, 1995, an additional 2,660,000
shares may be purchased in future periods under authorization
granted by the Board of Directors in September 1994.

In May 1995, the Company issued $150 million in senior debt securities under
a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in
1993. Net proceeds were used to retire short-term borrowings and for the
purchase of the Company's common shares. The Company may issue up to an
additional $150 million of debt securities in the future under this
registration statement.

LEGISLATIVE ISSUES
------------------

The Company's primary markets are highly competitive and subject
to substantial government regulation, and the trend is toward
more stringent regulation.  The Company expects debate to
continue during 1995 at both the federal and the state levels
over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for
health care products and services.  The Company believes that if
legislation is enacted, it could have the effect of reducing
prices, or reducing the rate of price increases, for health and
medical insurance and medical products and services.
International operations are also subject to a significant
degree of government regulation.  It is not possible to predict
the extent to which the Company or the health care industry in
general might be adversely affected by these factors in the
future.  A more complete discussion of these factors is
contained in Item 1, Business, in the Annual Report on Form
10-K, which is available upon request.

PART II.              OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.        LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

               The Company's 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 1995
reported 23 antitrust suits, one shareholder derivative suit, and seven
investigations in connection with the Company's marketing of infant formula
products.  During the second quarter, the trial court dismissed the cases that
were pending in the state courts of Colorado, Florida, Kentucky, Nevada, and
Tennessee.  The Colorado, Florida, and Nevada cases are now on appeal.  On May
22, 1995, the court denied class certification with respect to the case pending
in state court in Michigan.  On May 30, 1995, the court denied class
certification with respect to the case pending in state court in Minnesota.  On
June 19, 1995, a jury in federal court in Los Angeles, California found in favor
of the Company and the American Academy of Pediatrics in the anti-trust case
brought by Nestle Food Company.  Nestle Food Company has appealed this verdict.
On June 29, 1995, the Supreme Court of the State of Texas dismissed SEGURA V.
ABBOTT LABORATORIES, ET. AL.  As of June 30, 1995, 20 antitrust suits, one
shareholder derivative suit, and seven investigations are pending in
connection with the Company's marketing of infant formula products.

          The Company's 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 1995
reported 107 antitrust suits in connection with the Company's pricing of
prescription pharmaceuticals.  During the second quarter, the Company was
served with 15 new antitrust suits regarding the Company's pricing of
prescription pharmaceuticals.  Thirteen of these cases were consolidated in
the litigation that is pending in federal court in Chicago, Illinois and is
known as IN RE: BRAND NAME PRESCRIPTION DRUG ANTITRUST LITIGATION, MDL 997.
The two other cases, both of which purport to be class actions, were filed in
state court.  One was filed on May 24, 1995 in San Francisco County,
California on behalf of California consumers.  The other was filed on June 6,
1995 in Denver County, Colorado on behalf of Colorado consumers.   Each of
these cases alleges that various pharmaceutical manufacturers have conspired
to fix prices for prescription pharmaceuticals and/or to discriminate in
pricing to retail pharmacies by providing discounts to mail-order pharmacies,
institutional pharmacies and HMOs in violation of state and federal antitrust
laws.  The suits have been brought on behalf of individuals and retail
pharmacies and name both the Company and other pharmaceutical manufacturers
as well as pharmaceutical wholesalers and at least one mail-order pharmacy
company as defendants.  The plaintiffs in these cases seek treble damages in
an unspecified amount, civil penalties and other relief.  The Company has
filed or intends to file a response to each of the complaints denying all
substantive allegations.  As of June 30, 1995, a total of 122 antitrust suits
are pending in state and federal courts in connection with the Company's
pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals.

          While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending
claims, proceedings, and investigations with certainty, management is of the
opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows, or results of
operations.

           amortization; minority interest; and the portion of rentals
           representative of the interest factor, (ii) the Company

           representing return on capital, and (iii) fixed charges comprise
           total interest expense, including capitalized interest and such
           portion of rentals.
