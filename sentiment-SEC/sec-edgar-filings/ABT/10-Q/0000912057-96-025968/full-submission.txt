                               SEPTEMBER 30, 1996

                                  (UNAUDITED)


NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PREPARATION:

The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and footnote
disclosures normally included in audited financial statements.  However, in the
opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments)
necessary to present fairly the financial position, cash flows, and results of
operations have been made.  It is suggested that these statements be read in
conjunction with the financial statements included in the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1995.


NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE:

Earnings per common share amounts are computed by using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding.  These shares averaged 782,915,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 1996 and 797,321,000 for the same period
in 1995.


NOTE 3 - TAXES ON EARNINGS:

Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective tax rates.  The
effective tax rates are less than the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate
principally due to tax incentive grants related to subsidiaries operating in
Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Italy, Ireland, and the Netherlands.

(Unaudited), Continued


NOTE 4 - LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:

The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings including
numerous antitrust suits and investigations in connection with the sale and
marketing of infant formula products and the pricing of prescription
pharmaceuticals.

In addition, the Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party
for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United
States and Puerto Rico under Federal remediation laws and is voluntarily
investigating potential contamination at a number of Company-owned locations.

The matters above are discussed more fully in Item 1, Business - Environmental
Matters, and Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, which
is available upon request, and in Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings, in this
Form.

The Company expects that within the next year, progress in the legal proceedings
described above may cause a change in the estimated reserves recorded by the
Company.  While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending
claims, proceedings, investigations and remediation activities with certainty,
management is of the opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows, or
results of operations.


NOTE 5 - ACQUISITION OF MEDISENSE:

In the second and third quarters 1996, the Company acquired, for cash, all of
the outstanding shares of MediSense, Inc. (MediSense), a manufacturer of blood
glucose self-testing systems.  A substantial portion of the purchase price was
allocated to intangible assets, including goodwill, which will be amortized on a
straight-line basis over up to 40 years.  In addition, $37 million was charged
against earnings for acquired in-process research and development.  Had this
acquisition occurred on January 1, 1995, consolidated sales and net income would
not have been significantly different from reported amounts.

FINANCIAL REVIEW


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - THIRD QUARTER AND FIRST NINE MONTHS 1996 COMPARED WITH
SAME PERIODS IN 1995

Worldwide sales for the third quarter and first nine months increased 
10.7 percent and 8.1 percent, respectively, over the comparable 1995 periods. 
Net earnings increased 10.2 percent and 12.1 percent, respectively, in the third
quarter and first nine months 1996.  Earnings per share increased 12.5 percent
and 14.4 percent, respectively, over the prior year periods.

Gross profit margin (sales less cost of products sold, including freight and
distribution expenses) was 55.5 percent for the 1996 third quarter, compared to
55.2 percent for the 1995 third quarter.  First nine months gross profit margin
was 56.6 percent, compared to 56.2 percent a year earlier.  These increases are
due primarily to favorable product mix, especially higher sales of
pharmaceuticals, and productivity improvements; partially offset by higher
project expenses for new products and the effects of inflation.

Research and development expenses were $279.0 million for the third quarter 1996
and $852.4 million for the nine months 1996, including $37 million of acquired
in-process research and development related to the purchase of MediSense.  The
nine month 1995 results included a similar charge for the acquisition of certain
technologies.  Research and development represented 10.5 percent and 10.6
percent of net sales in the third quarter and first nine months 1996, compared
to 10.7 percent for both periods in 1995.  The majority of research and
development expenditures continues to be concentrated on pharmaceutical and
diagnostic products.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter and first
nine months 1996 increased 17.9 percent and 8.1 percent, respectively, over the
comparable prior year periods, net of the favorable effect of the relatively
stronger U.S. dollar of 2.8 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively.  The net
increases reflect additional selling and marketing support for new and existing
products, primarily for pharmaceutical and nutritional products, partially
offset for the nine months 1996 by lower litigation expenses and the absence of
contributions to the Company's charitable foundation in 1996.

Other (income) expense, net, includes net foreign exchange losses of
$4.5 million and $17.7 million, respectively, for the third quarter and first
nine months 1996 compared with net foreign exchange losses of $3.5 million and
$19.0 million for the corresponding prior year periods.  Other (income) expense,
net, also includes the Company's share of the income from joint ventures,
primarily TAP Holdings Inc., and minority interest expense.

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

Industry segment sales for the third quarter and first nine months 1996 and the
related change from the comparable 1995 periods are shown in the table below. 
The Pharmaceutical and Nutritional Products segment includes a broad line of
adult and pediatric pharmaceuticals and nutritionals, which are sold primarily
on the prescription or recommendation of physicians or other health care
professionals; consumer products; agricultural and chemical products; and bulk
pharmaceuticals.  The Hospital and Laboratory Products segment includes
diagnostic systems for consumers and for blood banks, hospitals, commercial
laboratories and alternate-care testing sites; intravenous and irrigation fluids
and related administration equipment; drugs and drug delivery systems;
anesthetics; critical care products; and other medical specialty products for
hospitals and alternate-care sites.

Domestic and international sales for the third quarter and first nine months
1996 primarily reflect unit growth. International sales were unfavorably
affected 6.5 percent by the relatively stronger dollar in the third quarter.  On
a year-to-date basis, international sales were unfavorably affected 4.0 percent
by the relatively stronger U.S. dollar.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AT SEPTEMBER 30, 1996
COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 1995                      

Net cash from operating activities for the first nine months 1996 totaled
$1.812 billion.  The Company expects annual cash flow from operating activities
to continue to approximate or exceed the Company's capital expenditures and cash
dividends.  The Company funded the acquisition of MediSense through commercial
paper borrowings.

The Company has maintained its favorable bond ratings (AAA by Standard & Poor's
Corporation and Aa1 by Moody's Investors Service) and continues to have readily
available financial resources, including unused domestic lines of credit of
$1.5 billion at September 30, 1996.  These lines of credit back up domestic
commercial paper borrowing arrangements.

During the first nine months 1996, the Company continued its program to purchase
its common shares.  The Company purchased and retired 13,155,000 shares during
this period at a cost of $570 million.  An additional 20,215,000 shares may be
purchased in future periods under authorization granted by the Board of
Directors in October 1996 and September 1995.  

In June 1996, the Company filed a registration statement with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.  The Company may issue up to $650 million of debt
securities in the future under this registration statement.

LEGISLATIVE ISSUES

The Company's primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial
government regulation.  The Company expects debate to continue at both the
federal and the state levels over the availability, method of delivery, and
payment for health care products and services.  The Company believes that if
legislation is enacted, it could have the effect of reducing prices, or reducing
the rate of price increases for medical products and services.  International
operations are also subject to a significant degree of government regulation. 
It is not possible to predict the extent to which the Company or the health care
industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. 
A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, in
the Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is available upon request.

       calculated by adjusting net earnings for taxes on earnings;
       interest expense; capitalized interest cost, net of amortization;
       minority interest; and the portion of rentals representative of
       the interest factor, (ii) the Company considers one-third of

       and (iii) fixed charges comprise total interest expense,
       including capitalized interest and such portion of rentals.
