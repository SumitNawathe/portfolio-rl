                                   (UNAUDITED)



NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PREPARATION:

The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and footnote
disclosures normally included in audited financial statements.  However, in the
opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments)
necessary to present fairly the financial position, cash flows, and results of
operations have been made.  It is suggested that these statements be read in
conjunction with the financial statements included in the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1994.


NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE:

Earnings per common share amounts are computed by using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding.  These shares averaged 801,262,000 for the
three months ended March 31, 1995 and 818,988,000 for the same period in 1994.


NOTE 3 - TAXES ON EARNINGS:

Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective tax rates.  The
effective tax rates are less than the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate
principally due to tax incentive grants related to subsidiaries operating in
Puerto Rico and Ireland.

NOTE 4 - LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:

The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings including
numerous antitrust suits and investigations in connection with the sale and
marketing of infant formula products and the pricing of prescription
pharmaceuticals.

In addition, the Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party
for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United
States and Puerto Rico under Federal remediation laws and is voluntarily
investigating potential contamination at a number of Company-owned locations.

The matters above are discussed more fully in Item 1, Business - Environmental
Matters, and Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, which
is available upon request, and in Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings, in this
Form.

While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending claims,
proceedings, investigations and remediation activities with certainty,
management is of the opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows, or
results of operations.



NOTE 5 - OTHER SIGNIFICANT EVENTS:

In December 1994, a United Kingdom subsidiary of the Company purchased the
operating assets of the nutritional business of Puleva Union Industrial y
Agroganadera, S.A. for $106 million.  Had this acquisition taken place on
January 1, 1994, consolidated sales and net income in 1994 would not have been
significantly different from reported amounts.

FINANCIAL REVIEW


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FIRST QUARTER 1995 COMPARED WITH FIRST QUARTER 1994

Worldwide sales for the first quarter increased 14.0 percent to $2.524 billion
from $2.215 billion in 1994.   Net earnings and earnings per share increased
13.9 percent and 15.6 percent, respectively, over the prior year quarter.

Gross profit margin (sales less cost of products sold, including freight and
distribution expenses) of 56.9 percent for the first quarter was up from
56.5 percent one year ago.  This increase was primarily due to product mix,
especially higher worldwide sales of pharmaceuticals, and productivity
improvements.

Research and development expenses increased to $247.2 million in the first
quarter 1995.  This represented 9.8 percent of net sales, compared to
10.2 percent in 1994.  The majority of research and development expenditures
continues to be concentrated on pharmaceutical and diagnostic products.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased
20.4 percent over the prior year, including the adverse effect of the relatively
weaker U.S. dollar of 1.9 percent.  The remaining increase reflects additional
selling and marketing expenses for new and existing products, primarily in the
pharmaceutical and nutritional segment.  The increase also reflects a
contribution to the company's charitable foundation and charges against earnings
for certain settled and pending litigation.

Other (income) expense, net, includes net foreign exchange losses of
$8.4 million in the 1995 first quarter, compared with net foreign exchange
losses of $12.2 million in the same quarter last year.

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

Industry segment sales for the first quarter 1995 and the related change from
the comparable 1994 period are shown in the table below.  The Pharmaceutical and
Nutritional Products segment includes a broad line of adult and pediatric
pharmaceuticals and nutritionals, which are sold primarily on the prescription
or recommendation of physicians or other health care professionals; consumer
products; agricultural and chemical products; and bulk pharmaceuticals.  The
Hospital and Laboratory Products segment includes diagnostic systems for blood
banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories and alternate-care testing sites;
intravenous and irrigation fluids and related administration equipment; drugs
and drug delivery systems; anesthetics; critical care products; and other
medical specialty products for hospitals and alternate-care sites.

Domestic and international sales for the first quarter primarily reflect unit
growth.  International sales were favorably affected 4.9 percent by the
relatively weaker dollar in the first quarter.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
(Continued)


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AT MARCH 31, 1995
COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 1994

Net cash from operating activities for the first quarter 1995 totaled
$508 million.  The Company expects annual cash flow from operating activities to
continue to approximate or exceed the Company's capital expenditures and cash
dividends.

The Company has maintained its favorable bond ratings (AAA by Standard & Poor's
Corporation and Aa1 by Moody's Investors Service) and continues to have readily
available financial resources, including unused domestic lines of credit of
$300 million at March 31, 1995.  These lines of credit support domestic
commercial paper borrowing arrangements.

During the first three months 1995, the Company continued its program to
purchase its common shares.  The Company purchased and retired 5,355,000 shares
during this period at a cost of $186 million.  As of March 31, 1995, an
additional  8,015,000 shares may be purchased in future periods under
authorization granted by the Board of Directors in September 1994.


LEGISLATIVE ISSUES

The Company's primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial
government regulation, and the trend is toward more stringent regulation.  The
Company expects debate to continue during 1995 at both the federal and the state
level over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care
products and services.  The Company believes that if legislation is enacted, it
could have the effect of reducing prices, or reducing the rate of price
increases, for health and medical insurance and medical products and services.
International operations are also subject to a significant degree of government
regulation.  It is not possible to predict the extent to which the Company or
the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors
in the future.  A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item
1, Business, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is available upon request.

            PART II.   OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

          The Company's 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1994
described 24 antitrust suits, one shareholder derivative suit, and 7
investigations (as of January 31,1995) that had been brought in connection with
the Company's marketing and sale of infant formula products.  During the first
quarter, three of these cases were certified as state consumer class actions.
The two cases that are pending in state court in Milwaukee, Wisconsin were
certified on February 28, 1995.  The case that is pending in state court in
Sedgwick County, Kansas was certified on March 2, 1995.  In addition, on April
3, 1995, the court dismissed the case which had been pending in federal court in
Reno, Nevada.  As of March 31, 1995 23 antitrust suits, one shareholder
derivative suit and 7 investigations are pending in connection with the
Company's marketing of infant formula products.

          The Company's 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1994
described 62 antitrust suits (as of January 31, 1995) in connection with the
Company's pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals.  During the first quarter, 44
new antitrust suits regarding the Company's pricing of prescription
pharmaceuticals commenced and were consolidated in the litigation that is
pending in federal court in Chicago, Illinois and is known as IN RE: BRAND NAME
PRESCRIPTION DRUG ANTITRUST LITIGATION, MDL 997.  In addition on February 9,
1995, a case was filed in the Circuit Court for Crow Wing County, Minnesota.
Each of these cases alleges that various pharmaceutical manufacturers have
conspired to fix prices for prescription pharmaceuticals and/or to discriminate
in pricing to retail pharmacies by providing discounts to mail-order pharmacies,
institutional pharmacies and HMOs in violation of state and federal antitrust
laws.  The suits have been brought on behalf of individuals and retail
pharmacies and name both the Company and other pharmaceutical manufacturers as
well as pharmaceutical wholesalers and at least one mail-order pharmacy company
as defendants.  The plaintiffs in these cases seek treble damages in an
unspecified amount, civil penalties and other relief.  The Company has filed or
intends to file a response to each of the complaints denying all substantive
allegations.  As of March 31, 1995, 107 antitrust suits are pending in
connection with the Company's pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals.

          On March 31, 1995 the Illinois Attorney General informed the Company
that it proposed the assessment of a civil penalty of $750,000 in connection
with an administrative enforcement action initiated in May of 1993 by the
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency against the Company.  The enforcement
action alleges that the Company violated its waste water discharge permits and
certain Illinois environmental laws at its North Chicago, Illinois facility.
The Company intends to defend itself in this matter and to deny all substantive
allegations.
<PAGE>

          While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending
claims, proceedings, and investigations with certainty, management is of the
opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows, or results of
operations.

      factor, (ii) the Company considers one-third of rental expense to be the
      amount representing return on capital, and (iii) fixed charges comprise
      total interest expense, including capitalized interest and such portion of
      rentals.
