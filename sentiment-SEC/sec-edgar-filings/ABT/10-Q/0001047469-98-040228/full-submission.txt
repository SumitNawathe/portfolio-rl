              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                               SEPTEMBER 30, 1998

                                   (UNAUDITED)

NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PREPARATION:

The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and 
footnote disclosures normally included in audited financial statements. 
However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only 
normal adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results of operations, 
financial position and cash flows have been made. It is suggested that these 
statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in 
the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1997.

NOTE 2 - TAXES ON EARNINGS:

Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective tax rates. The 
effective tax rates are less than the statutory U. S. Federal income tax rate 
principally due to tax incentive grants related to subsidiaries operating in 
Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Italy.

NOTE 3 - LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:

The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings including 
numerous antitrust suits and investigations in connection with the pricing of 
prescription pharmaceuticals. On September 9, 1998 the federal court approved 
the settlement of the independent retail pharmacy federal class action 
lawsuit for $57 million.

In addition, the Company has been identified as a potentially responsible 
party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the 
United States and Puerto Rico under Federal and state remediation laws and is 
investigating potential contamination at a number of Company-owned locations.

The matters above are discussed more fully in Note 10 to the financial 
statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is 
available upon request, and in Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings, in this 
Form.

The Company expects that within the next year, progress in the legal 
proceedings described above may cause a change in the estimated reserves 
recorded by the Company. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of 
such pending claims, proceedings and investigations with certainty, 
management is of the opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have 
a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows, or 
results of operations.

NOTE 4 - ACQUISITIONS:

On April 17, 1998, the Company acquired the common stock of International 
Murex Technologies Corporation for approximately $234 million in cash. A 
substantial portion of the purchase price was allocated to intangible assets, 
including goodwill, which is being amortized over 40 years. Had this 
acquisition taken place on January 1, 1997, consolidated sales and net income 
would not have been significantly different from reported amounts.

As of September 30, 1998, the cumulative net of tax balances for foreign 
currency translation loss adjustments and the unrealized (gains) on 
marketable equity securities were $329,820, and ($22,668), respectively.

NOTE 6 - STOCK SPLIT:

On February 13, 1998, the Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock 
split. Shareholders of record on May 1, 1998 were issued an additional share 
of the Company's common stock on May 29, 1998 for each share owned on the 
record date. All shares and per share data in the condensed consolidated 
financial statements and notes have been adjusted to reflect the stock split.

NOTE 7 - RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARD:

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative 
Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement requires the recognition 
of derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial 
position at fair value. The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning 
after June 15, 1999. The Company is assessing the impact this statement will 
have on its financial statements.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - THIRD QUARTER AND FIRST NINE MONTHS 1998 COMPARED 
WITH SAME PERIODS IN 1997

Worldwide sales for the third quarter and first nine months increased 6.0 
percent and 4.4 percent, respectively, over the comparable 1997 periods. 
Excluding the negative effect of the relatively stronger U.S. dollar, sales 
increased 9.3 percent and 7.7 percent, respectively, over the comparable 1997 
periods. Net earnings increased 12.8 percent and 11.7 percent, respectively, 
in the third quarter and first nine months 1998. Basic earnings per common 
share increased 12.9 percent and 13.1 percent, respectively, over the prior 
year periods. Diluted earnings per common share increased 13.3 percent and 
13.4 percent, respectively, over the prior year periods.

Gross profit margin (sales less cost of products sold, including freight and 
distribution expenses) was 54.7 percent for the 1998 third quarter, compared 
to 56.7 percent for the 1997 third quarter, and was negatively affected by 
the unfavorable effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. First nine months 1998 
gross profit margin was 56.8 percent, the same as a year earlier.

Research and development expenses were $292.1 million for the third quarter 
1998 and $879.1 million for the first nine months 1998. Research and 
development represented 9.6 percent of net sales for both the third quarter 
and first nine months 1998, compared to 11.4 percent and 10.6 percent, 
respectively, for the third quarter and the first nine months 1997. The 
majority of research and development expenditures continues to be 
concentrated on pharmaceutical and diagnostic products.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter and first 
nine months 1998 decreased 1.5 percent and increased 2.4 percent, 
respectively, over the comparable prior year periods, net of the favorable 
effect of the relatively stronger U.S. dollar of 3.3 percent and 3.4 percent, 
respectively. The net increases, exclusive of exchange impact, reflect 
inflation, additional selling and marketing support for new and existing 
products, primarily for pharmaceutical products, and litigation charges.

Other (income) expense, net, includes net foreign exchange losses of $5.6 
million for the third quarter and $20.6 million for the first nine months 
1998, compared to net foreign exchange gains of $4.3 million and $11.2 
million, respectively, for the corresponding prior year periods. Other 
(income) expense, net, also includes the Company's share of the net income 
from its joint venture, TAP Holdings, Inc., of $69.3 million for the 
third quarter and $189.9 million for the first nine months 1998, compared to 
$51.7 million and $142.3 million for the respective prior year periods.

On July 27, 1998, the Company announced that it was experiencing 
manufacturing difficulties with the capsule formulation of its protease 
inhibitor Norvir. The manufacturing difficulties with Norvir will result in 
shortages and interruption of the supply of capsules. The Company plans to 
supply Norvir liquid formulation to provide continued Norvir therapy for 
patients. During the first nine months

(Continued)

of 1998, the Company recorded sales of Norvir of $197.0 million. The Company 
is unable to quantify the effect that the production problems will have on 
sales in future periods.

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

Industry segment sales for the third quarter and first nine months 1998 and 
the related change from the comparable 1997 periods are shown in the table 
below. The Pharmaceutical and Nutritional Products segment includes a broad 
line of adult and pediatric pharmaceuticals and nutritionals, which are sold 
primarily on the prescription or recommendation of physicians or other health 
care professionals; consumer products; agricultural and chemical products; 
and bulk pharmaceuticals. The Hospital and Laboratory Products segment 
includes diagnostic systems for consumers, blood banks, hospitals, commercial 
laboratories and alternate-care testing sites; intravenous and irrigation 
fluids and related administration equipment; drugs and drug delivery systems; 
anesthetics; critical care products; and other medical specialty products for 
hospitals and alternate-care sites.

Domestic and international sales for the third quarter and first nine months 
1998 primarily reflect unit growth. Total sales were unfavorably affected 3.3 
percent and international sales were unfavorably affected 8.7 percent by the 
relatively stronger U.S. dollar in the third quarter. On a year-to-date 
basis, total sales were unfavorably affected 3.3 percent and international 
sales were unfavorably affected 8.6 percent by the relatively stronger U.S. 
dollar.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
(Continued)

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AT SEPTEMBER 30, 1998
COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 1997

Net cash from operating activities for the first nine months 1998 totaled 
$2.268 billion. The Company expects annual cash flow from operating 
activities to continue to approximate or exceed the Company's capital 
expenditures and cash dividends. The Company funded the acquisition of Murex 
through commercial paper borrowings.

The Company has maintained its favorable bond ratings (AAA by Standard & 
Poor's Corporation and Aa1 by Moody's Investors Service) and continues to 
have readily available financial resources, including unused domestic lines 
of credit of $2.505 billion at September 30, 1998. These lines of credit 
support domestic commercial paper borrowing arrangements.

During the first nine months 1998, the Company issued $400 million of debt 
securities under a registration statement filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission in 1996. The Company may issue up to $750 million of 
senior debt securities in the future under a registration statement filed 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission in September 1998.

During the first nine months 1998, the Company continued its program to 
purchase its common shares. The Company purchased and retired 17,248,000 
shares during this period at a cost of $673.7 million. As of September 30, 
1998, an additional 10,152,000 shares may be purchased in future periods 
under authorization granted by the Board of Directors in December 1997.

LEGISLATIVE ISSUES

The Company's primary markets are highly competitive and subject to 
substantial government regulation. The Company expects debate to continue at 
both the federal and the state levels over the availability, method of 
delivery, and payment for health care products and services. The Company 
believes that if legislation is enacted, it could have the effect of reducing 
prices, or reducing the rate of price increases for medical products and 
services. International operations are also subject to a significant degree 
of government regulation. It is not possible to predict the extent to which 
the Company or the health care industry in general might be adversely 
affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these 
factors is contained in Item 1, Business, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, 
which is available upon request.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARD

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative 
Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement requires the recognition 
of derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial 
position at fair value. The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning 
after June 15, 1999. The Company is assessing the impact this statement will 
have on its financial statements.

YEAR 2000

The Year 2000 ("Y2K") issue results from the inability of some computer 
programs to identify the Year 2000 properly, potentially leading to errors or 
system failure.

The Company has organized its efforts to resolve the Y2K issue as follows: 
internal information systems; landlord and embedded systems; electronic 
products currently marketed or in the field; and suppliers providing products 
and services to the Company. Progress goals have been established in each area.

Internal information systems were inventoried and assessed, and remediation 
started in 1992. Virtually all remediation is scheduled to be completed by 
the end of 1998, and testing completed by mid-1999. Current progress is 
slightly better than plan.

Landlord and embedded systems were inventoried and Y2K assessment completed 
by May 1998. The Company's goal is to resolve 75 percent of critical systems 
by year-end 1998, and 100 percent of critical systems by July 1999. Current 
progress is according to plan.

The Company has assessed the ability of its medical electronic and software 
products to cope with the Y2K issue. Customers may access the Company's 
assessment on the Company's internet web page. Most of the Company's products 
are not affected by the Y2K issue. For those products requiring remediation, 
the Company's goal is to provide solutions by June 1999. Current progress is 
according to plan.

Beginning in March 1998 key suppliers were requested to certify that they 
were Y2K compliant or, if not, to provide their plans to become compliant. 
Fifty-four percent of suppliers responded; 39 percent of those responding 
certified compliance currently and 61 percent forwarded action plans.  
Follow-up with all key suppliers is being conducted according to plan.

Each of the above areas will begin developing contingency plans by the end of 
1998, and will continue to develop and update those plans throughout 1999.

The Company's policy is to expense Y2K remediation costs as incurred. Future 
expenditures to remediate the Company's systems for the Y2K issue are not 
material to the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash 
flows.

EURO CONVERSION

On January 1, 1999, the European Economic and Monetary Union will take
effect and introduce the euro as the official single currency of the
eleven participating member countries. On that date the currency exchange
rates of the participating countries will be fixed against the euro.
There will be a three year transition to the euro, and at the end of 2001
the legacy currencies will be eliminated. In 1997 the Company organized
an internal cross-functional task force to address the euro issues and
expects to be ready for the conversion to the euro. Costs required to
prepare for the euro are not material to the Company's financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. The impact, if any, of the
euro on the Company's competitive position is unknown.

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

          As reported in the Company's 10-K for the fiscal year ended 
December 31, 1997, the Company is involved in numerous antitrust suits and 
two investigations regarding the Company's pricing of pharmaceutical 
products.  As of September 30, 1998, 117 antitrust suits are pending in the 
United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois as "In re: 
Brand Name Prescription Drug Antitrust Litigation, MDL 997."  A portion of 
the MDL 997 litigation has been certified as a class action on behalf of 
certain retail pharmacies.  In July 1998, the Company entered into an 
agreement to settle the class action portion of the MDL 997 litigation for 
$57 million.  On September 9, 1998, the United States District Court for the 
Northern District of Illinois approved that settlement agreement.  In 
addition, during the third quarter of 1998, three other lawsuits pending in 
the MDL 997 litigation, ALBERTSON'S V. ABBOTT, AMERICAN DRUG V. ABBOTT, and 
ECKERD V. ABBOTT, were settled and have now been dismissed.

          As of October 15, 1998, 24 pharmaceutical pricing cases were 
pending in various state courts and one case was pending in a District of 
Columbia court.   As reported in the Company's 10-K for the fiscal year ended 
December 31, 1997, the Company has entered into settlement agreements in 
twelve consumer lawsuits pending in the following jurisdictions:  Arizona, 
Florida, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota (2), New York, North Carolina, 
Tennessee, Washington, D.C., and Wisconsin.  The court in each jurisdiction 
must approve the agreement before it becomes final.  Courts in Michigan and 
Wisconsin have approved the settlement agreement.

          The Company has previously disclosed that cases are pending in the 
United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois between 
the Company and Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Geneva"), Invamed, Inc. 
("Invamed"), Novopharm Limited ("Novopharm"), Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
("Mylan"), and Warner Chilcott, Inc. ("Warner") in which the validity of the 
Company's patent claim covering the form of terazosin hydrochloride used by 
those companies has been contested.  The Geneva, Invamed, and Novopharm cases 
are all pending before the same judge, who, on September 1, 1998, entered a 
judgment in each of those cases ruling that the Company's patent claim is 
invalid.  The Company has appealed those judgments.  Both Mylan and Warner 
have filed motions seeking to have the September 1 ruling applied in their 
cases.

          While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending 
claims, proceedings, and investigations with certainty, management is of the 
opinion that their ultimate dispositions should not have a material adverse 
effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash 
flows.

          ABBOTT LABORATORIES, a corporation duly organized and existing 
under the laws of Illinois (herein called the "Company," which term includes 
any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value 
received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., as nominee for The Depository 
Trust Company, or registered assigns, the principal sum of Two Hundred 
Million Dollars ($200,000,000) on September 15, 2008 and to pay interest 
thereon from September 15, 1998 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date 
to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually on 
March 15 and September 15 in each year, commencing March 15, 1999, at the 
rate of 5.40% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available

may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more 
Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special 
Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the 
Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this 
series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at 
any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of

provided in said Indenture.

          Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and any such 
interest on this Security will be made at the office or agency of the Company

payment of public and private debts; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that at the option of 
the Company payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the address of 
the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security 
Register.

          Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed

the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one 
or more series under an Indenture, dated as of October 1, 1993 (herein called 
the "Indenture"), between the Company and Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as 
Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor 
trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures 
supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the 
respective rights,

limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the 
Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the 
Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  This Security is 
one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited in aggregate 
principal amount to $200,000,000.

          The Securities of this Series are not redeemable prior to maturity 
and do not provide for a sinking fund.

          If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series 
shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series 
may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in 
the Indenture.

          The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the 
entire indebtedness of this Security or certain restrictive covenants and 
Events of Default with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance 
with certain conditions set forth therein.

          The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, 
the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of 
the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to 
be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee

Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected.  The 
Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified 
percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time 
Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to 
waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and 
certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such 
consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and 
binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of 
any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange 
herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver 
is made upon this Security.

          No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this 
Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the 
Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any 
premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in 
the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

          As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations 
therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registerable in the 
Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of 
transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the 
principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly 
endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form 
satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the 
Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one 
or more new Securities of this series and of like

tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal 
amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

          The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form 
without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set 
forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate 
principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a 
different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering 
the same.

          No service charge shall be made for any such registration of 
transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient 
to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

          Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of 
transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the 
Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the 
owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and 
neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by 
notice to the contrary.

          All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture 
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
