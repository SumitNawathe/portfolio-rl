              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                 MARCH 31, 1997

                                   (UNAUDITED)



NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PREPARATION:

The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and footnote
disclosures normally included in audited financial statements.  However, in the
opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments)
necessary to present fairly the financial position, cash flows, and results of
operations have been made.  It is suggested that these statements be read in
conjunction with the financial statements included in the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1996.


NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE:

Earnings per common share amounts are computed by using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding.  These shares averaged 773,983,000 for the
three months ended March 31, 1997 and 785,836,000 for the same period in 1996.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 128 "Earnings per Share" in February 1997.  The Company
will adopt the Standard beginning with the year ended 1997.  The adoption of
this standard will not have a material effect on the Company's reported earnings
per share.

NOTE 3 - TAXES ON EARNINGS:

Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective tax rates.  The
effective tax rates are less than the statutory U. S. Federal income tax rate
principally due to tax incentive grants related to subsidiaries operating in
Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Italy, Ireland, and the Netherlands.

NOTE 4 - LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:

The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings including
numerous antitrust suits and investigations in connection with the sale and
marketing of infant formula products and the pricing of prescription
pharmaceuticals.

In addition, the Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party
for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United
States and Puerto Rico under Federal remediation laws and is voluntarily
investigating potential contamination at a number of Company-owned locations.

The matters above are discussed more fully in Item 1, Business - Environmental
Matters, and Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, which
is available upon request, and in 'Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings, in this
Form.

The Company expects that within the next year, progress in the legal proceedings
described above may cause a change in the estimated reserves recorded by the
Company.  While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending
claims, proceedings, investigations and remediation activities with certainty,
management is of the opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows, or
results of operations.

NOTE 5 - SUBSEQUENT EVENT:

On April 29, 1997, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire, for 
approximately $200 million, certain parenteral products businesses of Sanofi 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Had this acquisition taken place on January 1, 1996, 
consolidated sales and net income would not have been significantly different 
from reported amounts.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FIRST QUARTER 1997 COMPARED WITH FIRST QUARTER 1996

Worldwide sales for the first quarter increased 12.3 percent to $3.000 billion
from $2.672 billion in 1996.   Net earnings and earnings per share increased
11.4 percent and 13.1 percent, respectively, over the prior year quarter.

Gross profit margin (sales less cost of products sold, including freight and
distribution expenses) of 55.8 percent for the first quarter was down from
56.7 percent one year ago.  This decrease was primarily due to higher royalties
and project expense for new products and the effects of inflation; partially
offset by favorable product mix, especially sales of pharmaceuticals, and
productivity improvements.

Research  and development expenses increased to $280.1 million in the first
quarter 1997.  This represented 9.3 percent of net sales, compared to
10.1 percent in 1996.  The majority of research and development expenditures
continues to be concentrated on pharmaceutical and diagnostic products.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased
14.7 percent from the prior year as the result of additional selling and
marketing to support new product launches in the pharmaceutical and nutritional
segment, and due to the acquisition of MediSense in the second quarter of 1996.

Other (income) expense, net, includes net foreign exchange gains of
$10.9 million in the 1997 first quarter, compared with net foreign exchange
losses of $9.3 million in the same quarter last year.

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

Industry segment sales for the first quarter 1997 and the related change from
the comparable 1996 period are shown in the table below.  The Pharmaceutical and
Nutritional Products segment includes a broad line of adult and pediatric
pharmaceuticals and nutritionals, which are sold primarily on the prescription
or recommendation of physicians or other health care professionals; consumer
products; agricultural and chemical products; and bulk pharmaceuticals.  The
Hospital and Laboratory Products segment includes diagnostic systems for
consumers, blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories and alternate-care
testing sites; intravenous and irrigation fluids and related administration
equipment; drugs and drug delivery systems; anesthetics; critical care products;
and other medical specialty products for hospitals and alternate-care sites.

Domestic and international sales for the first quarter primarily reflect unit
growth.  International sales were unfavorably affected 5.5 percent by the
relatively stronger U. S. dollar in the first quarter.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
(Continued)

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AT MARCH 31, 1997
COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 1996

Net cash from operating activities for the first quarter 1997 totaled
$785 million.  The Company expects annual cash flow from operating activities to
continue to approximate or exceed the Company's capital expenditures and cash
dividends.

The Company has maintained its favorable bond ratings (AAA by Standard & Poor's
Corporation and Aa1 by Moody's Investors Service) and continues to have readily
available financial resources, including unused domestic lines of credit of
$1.5 billion at March 31, 1997.  These lines of credit support domestic
commercial paper borrowing arrangements.

During the first quarter 1997, the Company continued its program to purchase its
common shares.  The Company purchased and retired 3,995,000 shares during this
period at a cost of $228 million.  As of March 31, 1997, an additional
11,670,000 shares may be purchased in future periods under authorization granted
by the Board of Directors in October 1996.

LEGISLATIVE ISSUES

The Company's primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial
government regulation.  The Company expects debate to continue at both the
federal and the state levels over the availability, method of delivery, and
payment for health care products and services.  The Company believes that if
legislation is enacted, it could have the effect of reducing prices, or reducing
the rate of price increases for medical products and services.  International
operations are also subject to a significant degree of government regulation.
It is not possible to predict the extent to which the Company or the health care
industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future.
A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, in
the Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is available upon request.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
- -------   -----------------

          The Company's 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1996, 
described 6 antitrust suits and 5 investigations that had been brought in 
connection with the Company's marketing and sale of infant formula products.  
In its 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 1996, the Company reported that 
it had entered into a settlement agreement with plaintiffs involving 4 of 
these cases and that the settlement was subject to approval by the individual 
state courts.  On April 29, 1997, the Michigan Court gave final approval to 
the settlement.  Courts have not yet given their final approval for the cases 
pending in Alabama and Nevada. The Louisiana court denied final approval. The 
case in Louisiana will proceed. One infant formula antitrust case is also 
pending in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts.  It purports to be a 
statewide consumer class action.  An agreement has been reached to resolve 
this case for $1.5 million.  This agreement is subject to court approval.  On 
June 19, 1995, a jury in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, California found 
in favor of the Company and the American Academy of Pediatrics in the infant 
formula antitrust case brought by Nestle Food Company.  The Ninth Circuit 
Court of Appeals affirmed the jury's verdict on January 9, 1997, and the 
verdict was entered by the U.S. District Court on March 21, 1997. On April 
10, 1997, a case was filed in state court in St. Louis, Missouri. It also 
purports to be a statewide consumer class action. The case seeks treble 
damages, civil penalties, injunctive and other relief. As of April 29, 1997, 
5 antitrust suits and 5 investigations are pending in connection with the 
Company's sale and marketing of infant formula products.

          The Company's 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1996, 
described 142 antitrust suits and two investigations (as of January 31, 1997) 
in connection with the Company's pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals.  
Plaintiffs have filed two additional cases.  One of the cases was filed on 
January 8, 1997, in federal court. The Company was notified of its filing in 
March of 1997. The other was filed on February 24, 1997, in state court in 
Davidson County, Tennessee.  In addition, the cases pending in Dade County, 
Florida and Johnson County, Kansas were removed to the U.S. District Court 
for the Northern District of Illinois. As of March 31, 1997, 121 prescription 
pharmaceutical pricing antitrust cases were pending in federal court, 22 were 
pending in state courts, and 1 was pending in a District of Columbia court.  
The prescription pharmaceutical pricing antitrust suits allege that various 
pharmaceutical manufacturers have conspired to fix prices for prescription 
pharmaceuticals and/or to discriminate in pricing to retail pharmacies by 
providing discounts to mail-order pharmacies, institutional pharmacies and 
HMOs in violation of state and federal antitrust laws.  The suits have been 
brought on behalf of individuals and retail pharmacies and name both the 
Company and certain other pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmaceutical 
wholesalers and at least one mail-order pharmacy company as defendants.  The 
cases seek treble damages, civil penalties, injunctive and other relief.  The 
Company has filed or intends to file a response to each of the complaints 
denying all substantive allegations. The federal cases are pending in the 
United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under the 
Multidistrict Litigation Rules as IN RE: BRAND NAME PRESCRIPTION DRUG 
ANTITRUST LITIGATION, MDL 997.  One of the cases pending in the MDL 997 
litigation has been certified as a class action on behalf of certain retail 
pharmacies. The cases pending in California and the District of Columbia have 
also been certified as class actions. A number of appeals to the Seventh 
Circuit Court of Appeals have been filed arising out of  the MDL 997 
litigation.  All litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern 
District of Illinois is stayed pending the resolution of the appeals.

          While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending
claims, proceedings, and investigations with certainty, management is of the
opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows, or results of
operations.

                                    ARTICLE I

                                     OFFICES

       The principal office of the Corporation in the State of Illinois shall be
located at the intersection of State Routes 43 and 137 in the County of Lake.
The Corporation may have such other offices either within or without the State
of Illinois as the business of the Corporation may require from time to time.

       The registered office of the Corporation may be, but need not be,
identical with the principal office in the State of Illinois.  The address of
the registered office may be changed from time to time by the Board of
Directors.


                                   ARTICLE II

                                  SHAREHOLDERS

       SECTION 1.  ANNUAL MEETING; TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS, NOMINATION OF
DIRECTORS.  The annual meeting of the shareholders shall be held in the month of
April in each year on such date and at such time as the Board of Directors shall
provide.  The meeting shall be held for the purpose of electing Directors and
for the transaction of such other business as is properly brought before the
meeting in accordance with these By-Laws.  If the election of Directors shall
not be held on the day designated for any annual meeting, or at any adjournment
thereof, the Board of Directors shall cause the election to be held at a meeting
of the shareholders as soon thereafter as conveniently may be.

       To be properly brought before the meeting, business must be either (a)
specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at
the direction of the Board of Directors, (b) otherwise properly brought before
the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (c) otherwise
properly brought before the meeting by a shareholder.  In addition to any other
applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an annual
meeting by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof
in writing to the Secretary.  To be timely, a shareholder's notice must be
delivered to or mailed and received at the principal office of the Corporation,
not earlier than October 1 nor later than February 15 immediately prior to the
date of the meeting; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event that the date of such
meeting is not in the month of April and less than sixty-five days' notice or
prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to
shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so received not
later than the close of business on the fifteenth day following the day on which
such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public
disclosure was made, whichever first occurs.  A shareholder's notice to the
Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring
before the annual meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be
brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business
at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and record address of the shareholder
proposing such business, (iii) the class and number of shares of the

Corporation which are beneficially owned by the shareholder and (iv) any
material interest of the shareholder in such business.

       Notwithstanding anything in these By-Laws to the contrary, no business
shall be conducted at the annual meeting except in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 1, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing in this
Section 1 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any shareholder of any
business properly brought before the annual meeting.

       The Chairman of an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine
and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the
meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1, and if he should so
determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and such business not properly
brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.

       Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following
procedures shall be eligible for election as directors.  Nominations of persons
for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation at the annual meeting
may be made at such annual meeting of shareholders by or at the direction of the
Board of Directors, by any nominating committee or person appointed by the Board
of Directors, or by any shareholder of the Corporation entitled to vote for the
election of directors at such meeting who complies with the notice procedures
set forth in this Section 1.  Such nominations, other than those made by or at
the direction of the Board of Directors or by a committee or person appointed by
the Board of Directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to
the Secretary.  To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered to or
mailed and received at the principal office of the Corporation not earlier than
October 1 nor later than February 15 immediately prior to that date of the
meeting; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event that the date of such meeting is
not in the month of April and less than sixty-five days' notice or prior public
disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice
by the shareholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of
business on the fifteenth day following the day on which such notice of the date
of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever first
occurs.  Such shareholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth:  (a) as to
each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or re-
election as a director, (i) the name, age, business address and residence
address of the person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of the
person, (iii) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation
which are beneficially owned by the person and (iv) any other information
relating to the person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations for
proxies for election of directors pursuant to Regulation 14A under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and (b) as to the shareholder
giving the notice, (i) the name and record address of such shareholder and (ii)
the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned
by such shareholder.  The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to
furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation
to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as director of
the Corporation.  No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the
Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth herein.

       The Chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and
declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the
foregoing procedure, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the
meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.

       SECTION 2.  SPECIAL MEETINGS.  Special meetings of the shareholders may
be called by the Chairman of the Board, the President, the Board of Directors or
by the holders of not less than one-fifth of all the outstanding shares entitled
to vote on the matter for which the meeting is called.

       SECTION 3.  PLACE OF MEETING.  The Board of Directors may designate any
place, either within or without the State of Illinois, as the place of meeting
for any annual meeting or for any special meeting called by the Board of
Directors.  If no designation is made, or if a special meeting be otherwise
called, the place of meeting shall be the principal office of the Corporation in
the State of Illinois.

       SECTION 4.  NOTICE OF MEETINGS.  Written notice stating the place, day
and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered not less than ten
nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting, or in the case of a
merger, consolidation, share exchange, dissolution or sale, lease or exchange of
assets not less than twenty nor more than sixty days before the meeting, either
personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board, the
President, or the Secretary or the persons calling the meeting, to each
shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting.  If mailed, such notice
shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail,
addressed to the shareholder at his or her address as it appears on the records
of the Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid.

       SECTION 5.  FIXING RECORD DATE.  For the purpose of determining
shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders, or
shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a
determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of
Directors of the Corporation may fix in advance a date as the record date for
any such determination of shareholders, such date in any case to be not more
than sixty days and, for a meeting of shareholders, not less than ten days, or
in the case of a merger, consolidation, share exchange, dissolution or sale,
lease or exchange of assets not less than twenty days, immediately preceding
such meeting.

        SECTION 6.  VOTING LISTS.  The Secretary shall make, or cause to have
made, within twenty days after the record date for a meeting of shareholders or
ten days before such meeting, whichever is earlier, a complete list of the
shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting, arranged in alphabetical order,
with the address of and the number of shares held by each, which list, for a
period of ten days prior to such meeting, shall be kept on file at the
registered office of the Corporation and shall be subject to inspection by any
shareholder and to copying at the shareholder's expense, at any time during
usual business hours.  Such list shall also be produced and kept open at the
time and place of the meeting and shall be subject to the inspection of any
shareholder during the whole time of the meeting.  The original share ledger or
transfer book, or a duplicate thereof kept in this State, shall be prima facie
evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to examine such list or share
ledger or transfer book or to vote at any meeting of shareholders.

       SECTION 7.  QUORUM.  A majority of the outstanding shares of the
Corporation entitled to vote on a matter, represented in person or by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum for

<PAGE>

BY-LAWS                                                                  Page 4

consideration of such matter at a meeting of shareholders.  If a quorum is
present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares represented at the
meeting and entited to vote on a matter shall be the act of the shareholders,
unless the vote of a greater number or voting by classes is required by The
Business Corporation Act of 1983 or the Articles of Incorporation, as in effect
on the date of such determination.  If a quorum is not present, a majority of
the shares of the Corporation entitled to vote on a matter and represented in
person or by proxy at such meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time
without further notice.

       SECTION 8.  PROXIES.  A shareholder may appoint a proxy to vote or
otherwise act for the shareholder by signing an appropriate form and delivering
it to the person so appointed; provided, however, no shareholder may name more
than three persons as proxies to attend and to vote the shareholder's shares at
any meeting of shareholders.  No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of
eleven months from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy.
Each proxy continues in full force and effect until revoked by the person
executing it prior to the vote pursuant thereto, except as otherwise provided by
law.  Such revocation may be effected by a writing delivered to the Secretary of
the Corporation stating that the proxy is revoked or by a subsequent proxy
executed by, or by attendance at the meeting and voting in person by, the person
executing the proxy.  The dates contained on the forms of proxy presumptively
determine the order of execution, regardless of the postmark dates on the
envelopes in which they were mailed.

       SECTION 9.  VOTING OF SHARES.  Each outstanding share, regardless of
class, shall be entitled to one vote in each matter submitted to a vote at a
meeting of shareholders and, in all elections for Directors, every shareholder
shall have the right to vote the number of shares owned by such shareholder for
as many persons as there are Directors to be elected, or to cumulate such votes
and give one candidate as many votes as shall equal the number of Directors
multiplied by the number of such shares or to distribute such cumulative votes
in any proportion among any number of candidates; provided that, vacancies on
the Board of Directors may be filled as provided in Section 9, Article III of
these By-Laws.  A shareholder may vote either in person or by proxy.

       SECTION 10.  VOTING OF SHARES BY CERTAIN HOLDERS.  Shares of this
Corporation held by the Corporation in a fiduciary capacity may be voted and
shall be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares entitled
to vote at any given time.

       Shares registered in the name of another corporation, domestic or
foreign, may be voted by any officer, agent, proxy or other legal representative
authorized to vote such shares under the law of incorporation of such
corporation.

       Shares registered in the name of a deceased person, a minor ward or a
person under legal disability may be voted by his or her administrator,
executor, or court appointed guardian, either in person or by proxy without a
transfer of such shares into the name of such administrator, executor, or court
appointed guardian.  Shares registered in the name of a trustee may be voted by
him or her, either in person or by proxy.


       Shares registered in the name of a receiver may be voted by such
receiver, and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by
such receiver without the transfer

<PAGE>

BY-LAWS                                                                  Page 5

thereof into his or her name if authority so to do is contained in an
appropriate order of the court by which such receiver was appointed.

       A shareholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such
shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, and
thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred.

       SECTION 11.  VOTING BY BALLOT.  Voting on any question or in any election
may be viva voce unless the presiding officer shall order that voting be by
ballot.

       SECTION 12.  INSPECTORS OF ELECTION.  The Board of Directors in advance
of any meeting of shareholders may appoint inspectors to act at such meeting or
any adjournment thereof.  If inspectors of election are not so appointed, the
officer or person acting as chairman at any such meeting may, and on the request
of any shareholder or his proxy, shall make such appointment.  In case any
person appointed as inspector shall fail to appear or to act, the vacancy may be
filled by appointment made by the Board of Directors in advance of the meeting
or at the meeting by the officer or person acting as chairman.

       Such inspectors shall ascertain and report the number of shares
represented at the meeting, based upon their determination of the validity and
effect of proxies; count all votes and report the results; and do such other
acts as are proper to conduct the election and voting with impartiality and
fairness to all the shareholders.

       Each report of an inspector shall be in writing and signed by him or her
or by a majority of them if there be more than one inspector acting at such
meeting.  If there is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be
the report of the inspectors.  The report of the inspector or inspectors on the
number of shares represented at the meeting and the results of the voting shall
be prima facie evidence thereof.


                                   ARTICLE III

                                    DIRECTORS

       SECTION l.  GENERAL POWERS.  The business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed under the direction of the Board of Directors.

       SECTION 2.  NUMBER, TENURE AND QUALIFICATIONS.  The number of Directors
of the Corporation shall be twelve.  The terms of all Directors shall expire at
the next annual meeting of shareholders following their election.  Despite the
expiration of a Director's term, he or she shall continue to serve until the
next meeting of shareholders at which Directors are elected.  Directors need not
be residents of Illinois or shareholders of the Corporation.

       SECTION 3.  REGULAR MEETINGS.  A regular annual meeting of the Board of
Directors shall be held without other notice than this By-Law, immediately
after, and at the same place as, the annual meeting of shareholders.  Other
regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at the principal office
of the Corporation on the second Friday of every month at 9:00

<PAGE>

BY-LAWS                                                                  Page 6

a.m. without other notice than this By-Law.  The Board of Directors may provide,
by resolution, for the holding of the regular monthly meetings at a different
time and place, either within or without the State of Illinois, or for the
omission of the regular monthly meeting altogether.  Where the Board of
Directors has, by resolution, changed or omitted regular meetings, no other
notice than such resolution shall be given.

       SECTION 4.  SPECIAL MEETINGS.  Special meetings of the Board of Directors
may be called by or at the request of the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman of
the Executive Committee, the President, or of any four Directors.  The persons
authorized to call special meetings of the Board of Directors may fix any place,
either within or without the State of Illinois, as the place for holding any
special meeting of the Board of Directors.

       SECTION 5.  NOTICE.  Notice of any special meeting shall be given: (i) at
least one day prior thereto if the notice is given personally or by an
electronic transmission, (ii) at least two business days prior thereto if the
notice is given by having it delivered by a third party entity that provides
delivery services in the ordinary course of business and guarantees delivery of
the notice to the Director no later than the following business day, and (iii)
at least seven days prior thereto if the notice is given by mail.  For this
purpose, the term "electronic transmission" may include, but shall not be
limited to, a telex, facsimile, or other electronic means.  Notice shall be
delivered to the Director's business address and/or telephone number and shall
be deemed given upon electronic transmission, upon delivery to the third party
delivery service, or upon being deposited in the United States mail with postage
thereon prepaid.  Any Director may waive notice of any meeting by signing a
written waiver of notice either before or after the meeting.  Attendance of a
Director at any meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting,
except where a Director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting
to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened.  Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the
notice or waiver of notice of such meeting.

       SECTION 6.  QUORUM.  A majority of the number of Directors fixed by these
By-Laws shall constitute a quorum for transaction of business at any meeting of
the Board of Directors; provided, that if less than a majority of such number of
Directors are present at said meeting, a majority of the Directors present may
adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice.

       SECTION 7.  MANNER OF VOTING.  The act of the majority of the Directors
present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board
of Directors.

       SECTION 8.  INFORMAL ACTION BY DIRECTORS.  Any action required to be
taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any other action which may be
taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof, may be
taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so
taken, shall be signed by all of the Directors entitled to vote with respect to
the subject matter thereof, or by all the members of such committee, as the case
may be.

<PAGE>

BY-LAWS                                                                  Page 7

       The consent shall be evidenced by one or more written approvals, each of
which sets forth the action taken and bears the signature of one or more
Directors.  All the approvals evidencing the consent shall be delivered to the
Secretary of the Corporation to be filed in the corporate records.  The action
taken shall be effective when all the Directors have approved the consent unless
the consent specifies a different effective date.

       Any such consent signed by all the Directors or all the members of a
committee shall have the same effect as a unanimous vote.


       SECTION 9.  VACANCIES.  Any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors
and any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of
Directors, may be filled by election at an annual meeting or at a special
meeting of shareholders called for that purpose.  A Director elected to fill a
vacancy shall serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders.  A majority
of Directors then in office may also fill one or more vacancies arising between
meetings of shareholders by reason of an increase in the number of Directors or
otherwise, and any Director so selected shall serve until the next annual
meeting of shareholders, provided that at no time may the number of Directors
selected to fill vacancies in this manner during any interim period between
meetings of shareholders exceed 33-1/3 per cent of the total membership of the
Board of Directors.

       SECTION 10.  PRESUMPTION OF ASSENT.  A Director of the Corporation who is
present at a meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof at which
action on any corporate matter is taken is conclusively presumed to have
assented to the action taken unless his or her dissent is entered in the minutes
of the meeting or unless he or she files his or her written dissent to such
action with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting before the
adjournment thereof or forwards such dissent by registered or certified mail to
the Secretary of the Corporation immediately after the adjournment of the
meeting.  Such right to dissent shall not apply to a Director who voted in favor
of such action.

       SECTION 11.  APPOINTMENT OF AUDITORS.  Upon the recommendation of the
Audit Committee, the Board of Directors shall appoint annually a firm of
independent public accountants as auditors of the Corporation.  Such appointment
shall be submitted to the shareholders for ratification at the Annual Meeting
next following such appointment.  Should the holders of a majority of the shares
represented at the meeting fail to ratify the appointment of any firm as
auditors of the Corporation, or should the Board of Directors for any reason
determine that such appointment be terminated, the Board of Directors shall
appoint another firm of independent public accountants to act as auditors of the
Corporation and such appointment shall be submitted to the shareholders for
ratification at the Annual or Special Shareholders Meeting next following such
appointment.


                                   ARTICLE IV

                                   COMMITTEES

Each committee shall have three or more members, who serve at the pleasure of
the Board.  The Board shall designate one member of each committee to be
chairman of the committee.  The Board shall designate a secretary of each
committee who may be, but need not be, a member of the committee or the Board.

       SECTION 2.  COMMITTEE MEETINGS.  A majority of any committee shall
constitute a quorum and a majority of the committee is necessary for committee
action.  A committee may act by unanimous consent in writing without a meeting.
Committee meetings may be called by the Chairman of the Board, the chairman of
the committee, or any two of the committee's members.  The time and place of
committee meetings shall be designated in the notice of such meeting.  Notice of
each committee meeting shall be given to each committee member.  Each Committee
shall keep minutes of its proceedings and such minutes shall be distributed to
the Board of Directors.

       SECTION 3.  EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.  The Board shall appoint an Executive
Committee.  A majority of the members of the Committee shall be selected from
those Directors who are not then serving as full-time employees of the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries.

       SECTION 4.  DUTIES OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.  The Executive Committee
may, when the Board of Directors is not in session, exercise the authority of
the Board in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation;
provided, however, the Committee may not:

          (1)  authorize distributions;

          (2)  approve or recommend to shareholders any act the Business
Corporation Act of 1983 requires to be approved by shareholders;

of shares or determine the designation and relative rights, preferences, and
limitations of a series of shares, except that the Board may direct the
Committee to fix the specific terms of the issuance or sale or contract for sale
or the number of shares to be allocated to particular employees under an
employee benefit plan; or

          (9)  amend, alter, repeal, or take action inconsistent with any
resolution or action of the Board of Directors when the resolution or action of

NOTE:    For the purpose of calculating this ratio, (i) earnings have been
         calculated by adjusting net earnings for taxes on earnings;  interest
         expense; capitalized interest cost, net of amortization; minority
         interest; and the portion of rentals representative of the interest
         factor, (ii) the Company considers one-third of rental expense to be
         the amount representing return on capital, and (iii) fixed charges
         comprise total interest expense, including capitalized interest and
         such portion of rentals.
