                                   (UNAUDITED)



NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PREPARATION:

The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and footnote
disclosures normally included in audited financial statements.  However, in the
opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments)
necessary to present fairly the financial position, cash flows, and results of
operations have been made.  It is suggested that these statements be read in
conjunction with the financial statements included in the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1995.


NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE:

Earnings per common share amounts are computed by using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding.  These shares averaged 785,836,000 for the
three months ended March 31, 1996 and 801,262,000 for the same period in 1995.


NOTE 3 - TAXES ON EARNINGS:

Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective tax rates.  The
effective tax rates are less than the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate
principally due to tax incentive grants related to subsidiaries operating in
Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Italy, Ireland, and the Netherlands.

(Unaudited), Continued


NOTE 4 - LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:

The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings including
numerous antitrust suits and investigations in connection with the sale and
marketing of infant formula products and the pricing of prescription
pharmaceuticals.

In addition, the Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party
for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United
States and Puerto Rico under Federal remediation laws and is voluntarily
investigating potential contamination at a number of Company-owned locations.

The matters above are discussed more fully in Item 1, Business - Environmental
Matters, and Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, which
is available upon request, and in Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings, in this
Form.

The Company expects that within the next year, progress in the legal proceedings
described above may cause a change in the estimated reserves recorded by the
Company.  While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending
claims, proceedings, investigations and remediation activities with certainty,
management is of the opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows, or
results of operations.


NOTE 5 - ACQUISITIONS:

In March 1996, the Company and MediSense, Inc. ("MediSense") signed a definitive
agreement through which Abbott will acquire MediSense, a manufacturer of blood
glucose self-testing products.  Under the terms of the agreement, the Company
has made a tender offer to acquire 100 percent of the outstanding shares of
MediSense for approximately $876 million in cash.  The  purchase price will be
allocated to purchased research and development, goodwill, and the fair value of
net assets acquired based on pending valuations.  Acquisition of the majority of
the outstanding shares of MediSense will occur in the second quarter of 1996.
Had this acquisition taken place on January 1, 1995, consolidated sales and net
income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts.

The Company currently owns 70 percent of the capital stock of a Japanese
subsidiary.  During the first quarter, the Company entered into an agreement
with the minority interest shareholder to purchase their 30 percent ownership
over a ten-year period.

FINANCIAL REVIEW


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FIRST QUARTER 1996 COMPARED WITH FIRST QUARTER 1995

Worldwide sales for the first quarter increased 5.9 percent to $2.672 billion
from $2.524 billion in 1995.   Net earnings and earnings per share increased
15.1 percent and 17.3 percent, respectively, over the prior year quarter.

Gross profit margin (sales less cost of products sold, including freight and
distribution expenses) of 56.7 percent for the first quarter was down from
56.9 percent one year ago.  This decrease was primarily due to higher project
expense for new products and the effects of inflation; partially offset by
favorable product mix, especially sales of pharmaceuticals, and productivity
improvements.

Research and development expenses increased to $268.6 million in the first
quarter 1996.  This represented 10.1 percent of net sales, compared to
9.8 percent in 1995.  The majority of research and development expenditures
continues to be concentrated on pharmaceutical and diagnostic products.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the first quarter decreased
4.4 percent from the prior year as the result of lower charges for litigation in
1996 and non-recurring contributions to the Company's charitable foundation in
1995.  These decreases were partially offset by additional selling and marketing
support for new and existing products, primarily pharmaceuticals and
nutritionals.

Other (income) expense, net, includes net foreign exchange losses of
$9.3 million in the 1996 first quarter, compared with net foreign exchange
losses of $8.4 million in the same quarter last year.

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

Industry segment sales for the first quarter 1996 and the related change from
the comparable 1995 period are shown in the table below.  The Pharmaceutical and
Nutritional Products segment includes a broad line of adult and pediatric
pharmaceuticals and nutritionals, which are sold primarily on the prescription
or recommendation of physicians or other health care professionals; consumer
products; agricultural and chemical products; and bulk pharmaceuticals.  The
Hospital and Laboratory Products segment includes diagnostic systems for blood
banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories and alternate-care testing sites;
intravenous and irrigation fluids and related administration equipment; drugs
and drug delivery systems; anesthetics; critical care products; and other
medical specialty products for hospitals and alternate-care sites.

Domestic and international sales for the first quarter primarily reflect unit
growth.  International sales were unfavorably affected 0.1 percent by the
relatively stronger U.S. dollar in the first quarter.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
(Continued)


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AT MARCH 31, 1996
COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 1995

Net cash from operating activities for the first quarter 1996 totaled
$684 million.  The Company expects annual cash flow from operating activities to
continue to approximate or exceed the Company's capital expenditures and cash
dividends.  The Company will fund its acquisition of MediSense through
commercial paper borrowings.

The Company has maintained its favorable bond ratings (AAA by Standard & Poor's
Corporation and Aa1 by Moody's Investors Service) and continues to have readily
available financial resources, including unused domestic lines of credit of
$400 million at March 31, 1996.  These lines of credit support domestic
commercial paper borrowing arrangements.

During the first quarter 1996, the Company continued its program to purchase its
common shares.  The Company purchased and retired 3,655,000 shares during this
period at a cost of $152 million.  As of March 31, 1996, an additional 9,715,000
shares may be purchased in future periods under authorization granted by the
Board of Directors in September 1995.


LEGISLATIVE ISSUES

The Company's primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial
government regulation.  The Company expects debate to continue at both the
federal and the state levels over the availability, method of delivery, and
payment for health care products and services.  The Company believes that if
legislation is enacted, it could have the effect of reducing prices, or reducing
the rate of price increases for medical products and services.  International
operations are also subject to a significant degree of government regulation.
It is not possible to predict the extent to which the Company or the health care
industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future.
A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, in
the Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is available upon request.

                            PART II.     OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         The Company's 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1995
described 23 antitrust suits, one shareholder derivative suit, and 5
investigations (as of January 31, 1996) that had been brought in connection with
the Company's marketing and sale of infant formula products.  During the first
quarter, the Company entered into an agreement to settle 20 of these 23
antitrust suits.  The 20 cases that are covered by the settlement agreement are
the cases that are pending or on appeal in the following courts:  Calhoun
County, Alabama (2 cases); Boulder County, Colorado; Okaloosa County, Florida;
St. Clair County, Illinois; Sedgwick County, Kansas; Jefferson County, Kentucky;
Calhoun County, Michigan; Hennepin County, Minnesota; Ramsay County, Minnesota;
Holmes County, Mississippi; Washoe County, Nevada; Jackson County, North
Carolina; Burleigh County, North Dakota; Holmes County, South Dakota; Blount
County, Tennessee; Kanwaha County, West Virginia; and Milwaukee County,
Wisconsin (2 cases) and one (1) case pending in federal court in Louisiana.
Except for Mississippi, where the settlement has become final, each state's 
settlement becomes final only when it has been approved by the court in that 
state.  Under the terms of the agreement, without admitting any liability, the
Company will pay an aggregate amount of approximately $25 million in cash to
resolve the cases pending in Illinois, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, North
Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia, and Wisconsin and will provide infant 
formula products having an aggregate value of approximately $7.5 million 
dollars to resolve the cases pending in Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Kansas, 
Kentucky, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Tennessee.

         The Company's 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1995
described 133 antitrust suits (as of January 31, 1996) in connection with the
Company's pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals.  As of March 31, 1996, a
total of 139 cases and one investigation were pending in connection with the
Company's pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals.  In a letter dated March 13,
1996, the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") informed the Company that the FTC
is conducting an investigation to determine whether the Company has engaged or
is engaging in unfair competition in relation to the pricing of pharmaceutical
products in the United States.  During the first quarter of 1996, four new
federal antitrust suits regarding the Company's pricing of prescription
pharmaceuticals commenced and were consolidated in litigation that is pending in
federal court in Chicago, Illinois, and is known as IN RE: BRAND NAME
PRESCRIPTION DRUG ANTITRUST LITIGATION, MDL 997 ("MDL 997").  In addition, 
the following cases have been filed in state or local courts since January 31, 
1996:  RICHARD M. KERR V. ABBOTT, ET. AL., pending in Hennepin County, 
Minnesota, and HERBERT L. GODA V. ABBOTT, ET. AL., pending in the District of


<PAGE>

Columbia.  The above-mentioned cases allege that various pharmaceutical
manufacturers have conspired to fix prices for prescription pharmaceuticals
and/or discriminate in pricing to retail pharmacies by providing discounts to
mail-order pharmacies, institutional pharmacies, and health maintenance
organizations in violation of various state and federal antitrust laws.  The
suits have been brought on behalf of retail pharmacies and/or individual
consumers and name the Company and other pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well
as pharmaceutical wholesalers, and at least one mail-order pharmacy as
defendants.  The plaintiffs seek treble damages in an unspecified amount, civil
penalties and other relief.  The Company has filed or intends to file a response
to each of the complaints denying all substantive allegations.

    The Company's 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 1995 also
reported that the Company had entered into an agreement to settle the class
action portion of the MDL 997 litigation.  That settlement agreement had to be
approved by the federal court before it became final and effective.  On April 4,
1996, the federal court disapproved the settlement agreement.  The Company has
filed a request for permission to seek an interlocutory appeal of the denial of
the settlement agreement to the Federal Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit.

    On March 15, 1996, the North Carolina Department of Environment, Health,
and Natural Resources (the "Department") issued a Notice of Initiation of
Enforcement Action to the Company.  The Department alleges that during the
period between 1987 and 1993 the Company violated certain air quality
regulations in North Carolina.  The Company has filed a response to the 
notice.

    While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending claims,
proceedings, and investigations with certainty, management is of the opinion
that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.

          expense; capitalized interest cost, net of amortization; minority
          interest; and the portion of rentals representative of the interest
          factor, (ii) the Company considers one-third of rental expense to be
          the amount representing return on capital, and (iii) fixed charges
          comprise total interest expense, including capitalized interest and
          such portion of rentals.
