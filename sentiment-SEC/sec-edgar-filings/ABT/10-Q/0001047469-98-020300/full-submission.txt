NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PREPARATION:

The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and 
footnote disclosures normally included in audited financial statements.  
However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only 
normal adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, cash 
flows, and results of operations have been made.  It is suggested that these 
statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in 
the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1997.

NOTE 2 - TAXES ON EARNINGS:

Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective tax rates.  The 
effective tax rates are less than the statutory U. S. Federal income tax rate 
principally due to tax incentive grants related to subsidiaries operating in 
Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Italy, Ireland, and the Netherlands.

NOTE 3 - LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:

The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings including 
numerous antitrust suits and investigations in connection with the pricing of 
prescription pharmaceuticals.  In addition, the Company has been identified 
as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a 
number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under Federal and 
state remediation laws and is investigating potential contamination at a 
number of Company-owned locations.

The matters above are discussed more fully in Note 10 to the financial 
statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is 
available upon request.

The Company expects that within the next year, progress in the legal proceedings
described above may cause a change in the estimated reserves recorded by the
Company.  While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending
claims, proceedings and investigations with certainty, management is of the
opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows, or results of
operations.

NOTE 4 - ACQUISITIONS:

On April 17, 1998, the Company acquired International Murex Technologies 
Corporation for approximately $234 million in cash.  Had this acquisition 
taken place on January 1, 1997, consolidated sales and net income would not 
have been significantly different from reported amounts.

NOTE 6 - ADOPTION OF STATEMENT OF POSITION

In the first quarter, 1998, the Company elected early adoption of the provisions
of the American Institution of Certified Public Accountants' Statement of
Position 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
Obtained for Internal Use."  Adoption of the provisions of this statement will
not have a material effect on the financial statements of the Company.


NOTE 7 - STOCK SPLIT:

On February 13, 1998, the Company announced a two-for-one stock split. 
Shareholders of record at the close of business on May 1, 1998 will be issued an
additional share of the Company's common stock on May 29, 1998 for each share
owned on the record date.  The number of shares and the per share amounts
included in the March 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997 condensed consolidated
financial statements have not been restated for the stock split.


FINANCIAL REVIEW


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FIRST QUARTER 1998 COMPARED WITH FIRST QUARTER 1997

Worldwide sales for the first quarter increased 1.5 percent to $3.045 billion 
from $3.000 billion in 1997.   Excluding the negative effect of the 
relatively stronger U.S. dollar, sales increased 5.1 percent in the first 
quarter 1998 compared to 1997.  Net earnings increased 10.2 percent over the 
prior year quarter.  Basic earnings per common share and diluted earnings per 
common share increased 11.6 percent and 11.8 percent, respectively, over the 
prior year.

Gross profit margin (sales less cost of products sold, including freight and 
distribution expenses) of 58.0 percent for the first quarter was up from 55.8 
percent one year ago.  This increase was primarily due to productivity 
improvements and cost savings, partially offset by unfavorable product mix, 
primarily slower sales of pharmaceuticals.

Research and development expenses were $279.9 million in the first quarter 
1998.  This represented 9.2 percent of net sales, compared to 9.3 percent in 
1997.  The majority of research and development expenditures continues to be 
concentrated on pharmaceutical and diagnostic products.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased 
3.9 percent from the prior year, net of the favorable effect of the 
relatively stronger U.S. dollar of 3.9%.  This net increase reflects 
inflation and additional selling and marketing support for new and existing 
products, primarily for pharmaceutical and nutritional products.

Other (income) expense, net, includes net foreign exchange losses of $7.4 
million in the 1998 first quarter, compared with net foreign exchange gains 
of $10.9 million in the same quarter last year.

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

Industry segment sales for the first quarter 1998 and the related change from
the comparable 1997 period are shown in the table below.  The Pharmaceutical and
Nutritional Products segment includes a broad line of adult and pediatric
pharmaceuticals and nutritionals, which are sold primarily on the prescription
or recommendation of physicians or other health care professionals; consumer
products; agricultural and chemical products; and bulk pharmaceuticals.  The
Hospital and Laboratory Products segment includes diagnostic systems for
consumers, blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories and alternate-care
testing sites; intravenous and irrigation fluids and related administration
equipment; drugs and drug delivery systems; anesthetics; critical care products;
and other medical specialty products for hospitals and alternate-care sites.

Domestic and international sales for the first quarter primarily reflect unit
growth.  Total sales were unfavorably affected 3.6 percent and international
sales were unfavorably affected 9.5 percent by the relatively stronger U. S.
dollar in the first quarter.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AT MARCH 31, 1998
COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 1997                  


Net cash from operating activities for the first quarter 1998 totaled $881 
million.  The Company expects annual cash flow from operating activities to 
continue to approximate or exceed the Company's capital expenditures and cash 
dividends.  The Company funded the acquisition of Murex through commercial 
paper borrowings. 

The Company has maintained its favorable bond ratings (AAA by Standard & 
Poor's Corporation and Aa1 by Moody's Investors Service) and continues to 
have readily available financial resources, including unused domestic lines 
of credit of $1.5 billion at March 31, 1998.  These lines of credit support 
domestic commercial paper borrowing arrangements.

In the first quarter 1998, the Company issued $200 million of debt securities
under a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
in June 1996.  The Company may issue up to an additional $200 million under this
registration statement.

During the first quarter 1998, the Company continued its program to purchase its
common shares.  The Company purchased and retired 2,688,000 shares during this
period at a cost of $199 million.  As of March 31, 1998, an additional
11,012,000 shares may be purchased in future periods under authorization granted
by the Board of Directors in December 1997.


LEGISLATIVE ISSUES

The Company's primary markets are highly competitive and subject to 
substantial government regulation.  The Company expects debate to continue at 
both the federal and the state levels over the availability, method of 
delivery, and payment for health care products and services.  The Company 
believes that if legislation is enacted, it could have the effect of reducing 
prices, or reducing the rate of price increases for medical products and 
services.  International operations are also subject to a significant degree 
of government regulation. It is not possible to predict the extent to which 
the Company or the health care industry in general might be adversely 
affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these 
factors is contained in Item 1, Business, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, 
which is available upon request.

PART II.    OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.       LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

              The Company's 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1997 
described two antitrust suits and five investigations (as of January 31, 
1998) in connection with the Company's sale and marketing of infant formula 
products. During the first quarter of 1998, the court denied the Company's 
motion to dismiss the case pending in state court in St. Louis, Missouri.

              As reported in the Company's 10-K for the fiscal year ended 
December 31, 1997, the Company is involved in numerous antitrust suits and 
two investigations regarding the Company's pricing of pharmaceutical 
products.  As of March 31, 1998, 120 federal cases are pending in the United 
States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois as In re:  Brand 
Name Prescription Drug Antitrust Litigation, MDL 997.  Four cases previously 
pending in federal court were remanded to state court.  Numerous appeals have 
arisen out of the case pending in the MDL 997 litigation which has been 
certified as a class action on behalf of certain retail pharmacies.  The 
petition of the Company (along with other defendants) for certiorari to the 
United States Supreme Court seeking a reversal of the Court of Appeals' 
rulings on certain issues was denied on March 23, 1998. The federal retail 
pharmacy class action trial is scheduled to begin in September 1998.

              As of March 31, 1998, there were 25 cases pending in state court 
and one case pending in a District of Columbia court.   As noted above, the 
following four cases were remanded to state court by the federal court in the 
MDL 997 litigations:  Clark County, Alabama, Dade County, Florida, Johnson 
County, Kansas, and Davidson County, Tennessee.   The Company has entered 
into settlement agreements to settle the retail pharmacy lawsuits in 
Washington County, Wisconsin and one of the suits in Hennepin County, 
Minnesota.  The settlement agreement in the Minnesota lawsuit was approved on 
December 30, 1997. The settlement agreement in the Wisconsin lawsuit was 
approved on February 16, 1998.  Under the settlement agreements, the Company 
did not admit liability but did pay $42,767.32 in connection with the 
Minnesota lawsuit and $147,877.78 in connection with the Wisconsin lawsuit.  
Motions for certification as a consumer class action were denied in Maine, 
Michigan, and Minnesota.  Appeals of the consumer class certification 
decisions are pending in Maine and Michigan.  Trial in the individual 
consumer case pending in Michigan is scheduled for July 1998. 
          
              The Company's 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1997 
described five cases (as of January 31, 1998) involving the Company's patents 
for terazosin hydrochloride, a drug the Company sells under the trademark 
Hytrin-Registered Trademark-.  On March 31, 1998, the Company and Zenith 
reached an agreement that resolved the litigation between the parties.  In 
the settlement, Zenith acknowledged the validity of Abbott's terazosin 
hydrochloride patents and agreed to refrain from selling a generic version of 
terazosin hydrochloride until the expiration of one of Abbott's patents for 
terazosin hydrochloride (patent No. 4,251,532).  On April 1, 1998, the 
Company and Geneva reached an agreement under which Geneva will not market 
its Food and Drug Administration approved generic terazosin hydrochloride 
capsules until resolution of the pending litigation between the parties.  The 
Company agreed to make quarterly payments to Zenith and Geneva until the date 
on which they may enter the market for terazosin hydrochloride under their 
agreements.  Both Zenith and Geneva would be free to enter the market for 
terazosin hydrochloride in the United States if certain of the Company's 
patents for terazosin hydrochloride were determined to be invalid or if 
another company legally enters the generic market in the United States. On 
April 6, 1998, the Company sued Warner Chilcott, Inc. ("Warner") alleging 
infringement of one of the Company's patents for terazosin hydrochloride. 
Warner filed counterclaims alleging, among other things that the Company's 
agreements with Zenith and Geneva and its course of conduct with respect to 
terazosin hydrochloride violate the Antitrust laws. Warner seeks unspecified 
damages.

              While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending 
claims, proceedings, and investigations with certainty, management is of the 
opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse 
effect on the Company's financial position, cash flows, or results of 
operations.

</TABLE>

The preferences, qualifications, limitations, restrictions and the special or
relative rights in respect of the shares of each class are:

SECTION A

The Preferred Shares

1.   The Preferred Shares may be issued in one or more series and

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

with such designation for each such series sufficient to distinguish the 
shares thereof from the shares of all other series and classes, as shall be 
stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue 
of each such series adopted by the Board of Directors.  The Board of 
Directors in any such resolution or resolutions is hereby expressly 
authorized to divide the Preferred Shares into series and to fix and 
determine the relative rights and preferences of the shares of any series so 
established as to:

          (i)       The rate per annum at which the holders of shares shall be
                    entitled to receive dividends.

          (ii)      The price at and the terms and conditions on which shares
                    may be redeemed.

          (iii)     The amount payable upon shares in event of involuntary
                    liquidation.

          (iv)      The amount payable upon shares in event of voluntary
                    liquidation.

          (v)       The sinking fund provisions, if any, for the redemption or
                    purchase of shares.

          (vi)      The terms and conditions on which shares may be converted,
                    if the shares are issued with the privilege of conversion.

     The Board of Directors may increase the number of shares designated for any
     existing series by a resolution adding to such series authorized and
     unissued Preferred Shares not designated for any other series.

2.   All preferred Shares of any one series shall be identical with each other
in all respects, except that shares of any one series issued at different times
as provided in paragraph 3 of this Section A, may differ as to the dates from
which dividends thereon shall be cumulative.

3.   Before any dividends on the Common Shares or on any other class or classes
of shares of the Corporation, ranking junior to the Preferred Shares with
respect to payment of dividends, shall be paid or declared or set apart for
payment, the holders of Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive when and
as declared by the Board of Directors, cumulative cash dividends, out of any
funds legally available for the declaration of dividends and in the case of each
series at the rate per annum, and no more, for the particular series fixed in
the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such series of
Preferred Shares, adopted by the Board of Directors, payable quarterly on such
dates, in each year, as may be fixed in such resolution or resolutions.  With
respect to each series of the Preferred Shares, such dividends shall be
cumulative from the respective dates of issue thereof. No dividends shall be
paid on any series of the Preferred Shares in respect of any dividend period
unless

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

all cumulative dividends accrued prior to said dividend period with respect 
to all Preferred Shares of each other series shall have been paid or declared 
and set aside for payment.

4.   The holders of Preferred Shares shall be entitled to vote as a class and
otherwise as provided by law.

5.   Preferred shares which have been redeemed or shall have been purchased,
converted or otherwise acquired by the Corporation may thereafter be reissued
under such terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of this
Section A, as the Board of Directors may thereafter determine.

6.   In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, and before any distribution of the assets of the
Corporation shall be made to or set apart for the holders of the Common Shares
or of any other class of shares of the Corporation ranking junior to the
Preferred Shares with respect to payment of dividends or upon dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of the shares of each
series of the Preferred Shares then outstanding shall be entitled to receive
payment of such amount, as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or
resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issue of such
series; but such holders upon receipt of such payment shall be entitled to no
further payment.

7.   In case of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation,
if the amounts payable with respect to all series of Preferred Shares then
outstanding are not paid in full, the shares of all series of the Preferred
Shares shall share proportionately in accordance with the respective amounts
which would be payable on said shares if all amounts payable were paid in full.

8.   A consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into one or more
corporations shall not be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up
within the meaning of this Section A.

SECTION B

The Common Shares

1.   Subject to the limitations set forth in Section A of this Restated Article
R-V, the holders of Common Shares shall be entitled to dividends if, when and as
the same shall be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds of the
Corporation legally available thereof.

2.   The holders of Common Shares shall be entitled to vote as provided by law.

                                      -5-
<PAGE>


SECTION C

The Preferred and Common Shares

No holder of shares of any class of the Corporation shall be entitled as of
right to subscribe to or purchase any additional or increased shares of any
class (whether now or hereafter authorized), or obligations convertible into any
class or classes of shares (whether now or hereafter authorized), or shares of
any class convertible into shares of any other class or classes (whether now or
hereafter authorized), or obligations, shares or other securities carrying
warrants or rights to subscribe to shares of the Corporation of any class or
classes (whether now or hereafter authorized), but any and all shares, bonds,
debentures or other securities or obligations, whether or not convertible into
shares or carrying warrants entitling the holders thereof to subscribe to
shares, may be issued, sold or disposed of from time to time by the board of
Directors to such persons, firms or corporations and for such consideration (so
far as may be permitted by law, by the Articles of Incorporation of the
Corporation, and by the terms of any resolution creating any series of Preferred
Shares) as the Board of Directors shall from time to time in its absolute
discretion determine. Among other things the Board of Directors shall have the
right at any time and from time to time to offer, sell and issue shares of any
class of the Corporation, or obligations, shares or other securities carrying
warrants or rights to subscribe to shares of the Corporation of any class or
classes, to employees of the Corporation and to employees of subsidiaries of the
Corporation without first offering the same to its share holders, for such
prices or considerations, and upon such terms and conditions as the Board of
Directors shall from time to time determine, and upon any such issuance and
sale, or plan or proposal to issue and sell, the Board of Directors may classify
employees as in its discretion it may deem advisable, and may differentiate
between classes, and exclude any class from participation.  The fact that an
employee may be a director or an officer of the Corporation, or any of its
subsidiaries, shall not disqualify him from participation as an employee in any
such issuance or sale to employees.

                                      -6-

RESTATED ARTICLE R-VI

1.   A director of the corporation shall not be personally liable to the
     corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of
     fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of
     the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its shareholders, (ii)
     for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional
     misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 8.65 of the
     Illinois Business Corporation Act, or (iv) for any transaction from which
     the director derived an improper personal benefit; provided that the
     foregoing provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a
     director for any act or omission occurring before the date this provision

2.   Any person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party to

     a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,

                                      OFFICES

     The principal office of the Corporation in the State of Illinois shall be
located at the intersection of State Routes 43 and 137 in the County of Lake. 
The Corporation may have such other offices either within or without the State
of Illinois as the business of the Corporation may require from time to time.

     The registered office of the Corporation may be, but need not be, identical
with the principal office in the State of Illinois.  The address of the
registered office may be changed from time to time by the Board of Directors.


                                     ARTICLE II
                                          
                                    SHAREHOLDERS

     SECTION 1.  ANNUAL MEETING; TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS, NOMINATION OF
DIRECTORS.  The annual meeting of the shareholders shall be held in the month of
April in each year on such date and at such time as the Board of Directors shall
provide.  The meeting shall be held for the purpose of electing Directors and
for the transaction of such other business as is properly brought before the
meeting in accordance with these By-Laws.  If the election of Directors shall
not be held on the day designated for any annual meeting, or at any adjournment
thereof, the Board of Directors shall cause the election to be held at a meeting
of the shareholders as soon thereafter as conveniently may be.

     To be properly brought before the meeting, business must be either (a)
specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at
the direction of the Board of Directors, (b) otherwise properly brought before
the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (c) otherwise
properly brought before the meeting by a shareholder.  In addition to any other
applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an annual
meeting by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof
in writing to the Secretary.  To be timely, a shareholder's notice must be
delivered to or mailed and received at the principal office of the Corporation,
not earlier than October 1 nor later than February 15 immediately prior to the
date of the meeting; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event that the date of such
meeting is not in the month of April and less than sixty-five days' notice or
prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to
shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so received not
later than the close of business on the fifteenth day following the day on which
such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such

public disclosure was made, whichever first occurs.  A shareholder's notice 
to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the shareholder proposes 
to bring before the annual meeting (i) a brief description of the business 
desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for 
conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and record 
address of the shareholder proposing such business, (iii) the class and 
number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the 
shareholder and (iv) any material interest of the shareholder in such 
business.

     Notwithstanding anything in these By-Laws to the contrary, no business
shall be conducted at the annual meeting except in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 1, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing in this
Section 1 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any shareholder of any
business properly brought before the annual meeting.

     The Chairman of an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine
and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the
meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1, and if he should so
determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and such business not properly
brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.

     Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures
shall be eligible for election as directors.  Nominations of persons for
election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation at the annual meeting may
be made at such annual meeting of shareholders by or at the direction of the
Board of Directors, by any nominating committee or person appointed by the Board
of Directors, or by any shareholder of the Corporation entitled to vote for the
election of directors at such meeting who complies with the notice procedures
set forth in this Section 1.  Such nominations, other than those made by or at
the direction of the Board of Directors or by a committee or person appointed by
the Board of Directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to
the Secretary.  To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered to or
mailed and received at the principal office of the Corporation not earlier than
October 1 nor later than February 15 immediately prior to that date of the
meeting; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event that the date of such meeting is
not in the month of April and less than sixty-five days' notice or prior public
disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice
by the shareholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of
business on the fifteenth day following the day on which such notice of the
date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever
first occurs.  Such shareholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth:  (a)
as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or
re-election as a director, (i) the name, age, business address and residence
address of the person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of the
person, (iii) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation
which are beneficially owned by the person and (iv) any other information
relating to the person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations for
proxies for election of directors pursuant to Regulation 14A under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended;  and (b) as to the shareholder
giving the notice, (i) the name and record address of such shareholder and (ii)
the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned
by such shareholder.  The Corporation

may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may 
reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of 
such proposed nominee to serve as director of the Corporation.  No person 
shall be eligible for election as a director of the Corporation unless 
nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth herein.

     The Chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and
declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the
foregoing procedure, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the
meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.

     SECTION 2.  SPECIAL MEETINGS.  Special meetings of the shareholders may be
called by the Chairman of the Board, the President, the Board of Directors or by
the holders of not less than one-fifth of all the outstanding shares entitled to
vote on the matter for which the meeting is called.

     SECTION 3.  PLACE OF MEETING.  The Board of Directors may designate any
place, either within or without the State of Illinois, as the place of meeting
for any annual meeting or for any special meeting called by the Board of
Directors.  If no designation is made, or if a special meeting be otherwise
called, the place of meeting shall be the principal office of the Corporation in
the State of Illinois.

     SECTION 4.  NOTICE OF MEETINGS.  Written notice stating the place, day and
hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered not less than ten
nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting, or in the cases of a
merger, consolidation, share exchange, dissolution or sale, lease or exchange of
assets not less than twenty nor more than sixty days before the meeting, either
personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board, the
President, or the Secretary or the persons calling the meeting, to each
shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting.  If mailed, such notice
shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail,
addressed to the shareholder at his or her address as it appears on the records
of the Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid.

     SECTION 5.  FIXING RECORD DATE.  For the purpose of determining
shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders, or
shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a
determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of
Directors of the Corporation may fix in advance a date as the record date for
any such determination of shareholders, such date in any case to be not more
than sixty days and, for a meeting of shareholders, not less than ten days, or
in the case of a merger, consolidation, share exchange, dissolution or sale,
lease or exchange of assets not less than twenty days, immediately preceding
such meeting.

     SECTION 6.  VOTING LISTS.  The Secretary shall make, or cause to have made,
within twenty days after the record date for a meeting of shareholders or ten
days before such meeting,

whichever is earlier, a complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote at 
such meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of and the 
number of shares held by each, which list, for a period of ten days prior to 
such meeting, shall be kept on file at the registered office of the 
Corporation and shall be subject to inspection by any shareholder and to 
copying at the shareholder's expense, at any time during usual business 
hours.  Such list shall also be produced and kept open at the time and place 
of the meeting and shall be subject to the inspection of any shareholder 
during the whole time of the meeting.  The original share ledger or transfer 
book, or a duplicate thereof kept in this State, shall be prima facie 
evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to examine such list or 
share ledger or transfer book or to vote at any meeting of shareholders.

     SECTION 7.  QUORUM.  A majority of the outstanding shares of the 
Corporation entitled to vote on a matter, represented in person or by proxy, 
shall constitute a quorum for consideration of such matter at a meeting of 
shareholders.  If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority 
of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on a matter 
shall be the act of the shareholders, unless the vote of a greater number or 
voting by classes is required by The Business Corporation Act of 1983 or the 
Articles of Incorporation, as in effect on the date of such determination.  
If a quorum is not present, a majority of the shares of the Corporation 
entitled to vote on a matter and represented in person or by proxy at such 
meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice.

     SECTION 8.  PROXIES.  A shareholder may appoint a proxy to vote or 
otherwise act for the shareholder by signing an appropriate form and 
delivering it to the person so appointed; provided, however, no shareholder 
may name more than three persons as proxies to attend and to vote the 
shareholder's shares at any meeting of shareholders.  No proxy shall be valid 
after the expiration of eleven months from the date thereof unless otherwise 
provided in the proxy. Each proxy continues in full force and effect until 
revoked by the person executing it prior to the vote pursuant thereto, except 
as otherwise provided by law.  Such revocation may be effected by a writing 
delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation stating that the proxy is 
revoked or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or by attendance at the meeting 
and voting in person by, the person executing the proxy.  The dates contained 
on the forms of proxy presumptively determine the order of execution, 
regardless of the postmark dates on the envelopes in which they were mailed.

     SECTION 9.  VOTING OF SHARES.  Each outstanding share, regardless of 
class, shall be entitled to one vote in each matter submitted to a vote at a 
meeting of shareholders and, in all elections for Directors, every 
shareholder shall have the right to vote the number of shares owned by such 
shareholder for as many persons as there are Directors to be elected, or to 
cumulate such votes and give one candidate as many votes as shall equal the 
number of Directors multiplied by the number of such shares or to distribute 
such cumulative votes in any proportion among any number of candidates; 
provided that, vacancies on the Board of Directors may be filled as provided 
in Section 9, Article III of these By-Laws.  A shareholder may vote either in 
person or by proxy.

     SECTION 10.  VOTING OF SHARES BY CERTAIN HOLDERS.  Shares of this
Corporation held by the Corporation in a fiduciary capacity may be voted and
shall be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares entitled
to vote at any given time.

     Shares registered in the name of another corporation, domestic or foreign,
may be voted by any officer, agent, proxy or other legal representative
authorized to vote such shares under the law of incorporation of such
corporation.

     Shares registered in the name of a deceased person, a minor ward or a 
person under legal disability may be voted by his or her administrator, 
executor, or court appointed guardian, either in person or by proxy without a 
transfer of such shares into the name of such administrator, executor, or 
court appointed guardian.  Shares registered in the name of a trustee may be 
voted by him or her, either in person or by proxy.

     Shares registered in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver,
and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by such
receiver without the transfer thereof into his or her name if authority so to do
is contained in an appropriate order of the court by which such receiver was
appointed.

     A shareholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such
shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, and
thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred.

     SECTION 11.  VOTING BY BALLOT.  Voting on any question or in any election
may be viva voce unless the presiding officer shall order that voting be by
ballot.

     SECTION 12.  INSPECTORS OF ELECTION.  The Board of Directors in advance of
any meeting of shareholders may appoint inspectors to act at such meeting or any
adjournment thereof.  If inspectors of election are not so appointed, the
officer or person acting as chairman at any such meeting may, and on the request
of any shareholder or his proxy, shall make such appointment.  In case any
person appointed as inspector shall fail to appear or to act, the vacancy may be
filled by appointment made by the Board of Directors in advance of the meeting
or at the meeting by the officer or person acting as chairman.

     Such inspectors shall ascertain and report the number of shares represented
at the meeting, based upon their determination of the validity and effect of
proxies; count all votes and report the results; and do such other acts as are
proper to conduct the election and voting with impartiality and fairness to all
the shareholders.

     Each report of an inspector shall be in writing and signed by him or her or
by a majority of them if there be more than one inspector acting at such
meeting.  If there is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be
the report of the inspectors.  The report of the inspector or inspectors on the
number of shares represented at the meeting and the results of the

voting shall be prima facie evidence thereof.

     SECTION 1.  GENERAL POWERS.  The business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed under the direction of the Board of Directors.

     SECTION 2.  NUMBER, TENURE AND QUALIFICATIONS.  The number of Directors of
the Corporation shall be sixteen.  The terms of all Directors shall expire at
the next annual meeting of shareholders following their election.  Despite the
expiration of a Director's term, he or she shall continue to serve until the
next meeting of shareholders at which Directors are elected.  Directors need not
be residents of Illinois or shareholders of the Corporation.

     SECTION 3.  REGULAR MEETINGS.  A regular annual meeting of the Board of
Directors shall be held without other notice than this By-Law, immediately
after, and at the same place as, the annual meeting of shareholders.  Other
regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at the principal office
of the Corporation on the second Friday of every month at 9:00 a.m. without
other notice than this By-Law.  The Board of Directors may provide, by
resolution, for the holding of the regular monthly meetings at a different time
and place, either within or without the State of Illinois, or for the omission
of the regular monthly meeting altogether.  Where the Board of Directors has, by
resolution, changed or omitted regular meetings, no other notice than such
resolution shall be given.

     SECTION 4.  SPECIAL MEETINGS.  Special meetings of the Board of Directors
may be called by or at the request of the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman of
the Executive Committee, the President, or of any four Directors.  The persons
authorized to call special meetings of the Board of Directors may fix any place,
either within or without the State of Illinois, as the place for holding any
special meeting of the Board of Directors.

     SECTION 5.  NOTICE.  Notice of any special meeting shall be given:  (i) 
at least one day prior thereto if the notice is given personally or by an 
electronic transmission, (ii) at least two business days prior thereto if the 
notice is given by having it delivered by a third party entity that provides 
delivery services in the ordinary  course of business and guarantees delivery 
of the notice to the Director no later than the following business day, and 
(iii) at least seven days prior thereto if the notice is given by mail.  For 
this purpose, the term "electronic transmission" may include, but shall not 
be limited to, a telex, facsimile, or other electronic means.  Notice shall 
be delivered to the Director's business address and/or telephone number and 
shall be deemed given upon electronic transmission, upon delivery to the 
third party delivery service, or upon being deposited in the United States 
mail with postage thereon prepaid.  Any Director may waive notice of any 
meeting by signing a written waiver of notice either before or after the 
meeting. Attendance of a Director at any meeting shall constitute a waiver of 
notice of such meeting,

except where a Director attends a meeting for the express purpose of 
objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not 
lawfully called or convened.  Neither the business to be transacted at, nor 
the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors need 
to be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting.

     SECTION 6.  QUORUM.  A majority of the number of Directors fixed by these
By-Laws shall constitute a quorum for transaction of business at any meeting of
the Board of Directors; provided, that if less than a majority of such number of
Directors are present at said meeting, a majority of the Directors present may
adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice.

     SECTION 7.  MANNER OF VOTING.  The act of the majority of the Directors
present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board
of Directors.

     SECTION 8.  INFORMAL ACTION BY DIRECTORS.  Any action required to be taken
at a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any other action which may be taken
at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof, may be taken
without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken,
shall be signed by all of the Directors entitled to vote with respect to the
subject matter thereof, or by all the members of such committee, as the case may
be.

     The consent shall be evidenced by one or more written approvals, each of
which sets forth the action taken and bears the signature of one or more

1998 ABBOTT LABORATORIES PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN

SECTION 1.  ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSES

     1.1  ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PLAN.  Abbott Laboratories ("Abbott") hereby 
establishes the "1998 Abbott Laboratories Performance Incentive Plan" (the 
"Plan"), as set forth in this document.

     Subject to approval by Abbott's shareholders at the 1998 Annual Meeting 
of the Shareholders, the Plan shall become effective as of January 1, 1998 
(the "Effective Date") and shall remain in effect as provided in Section 6.1 
hereof.

     1.2  PURPOSES OF THE PLAN.  The purposes of the Plan are to:

     (a)  Prove flexibility to Abbott in its ability to attract, motivate, 
          and retain the services of participants in the Plan 
          ("Participants") who make significant contributions to Abbott's 
          success and to allow Participants to share in the success of Abbott.
     (b)  Optimize the profitability and growth of Abbott through incentives 
          which are consistent with Abbott's goals and which link the
          performance objectives of Participants to those of Abbott's 
          shareholders; and
     (c)  Provide Participants with an incentive for excellence in individual 
          performance.


SECTION 2.  ADMINISTRATION

     2.1  GENERAL.  The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation 
Committee (the "Committee") appointed by the Board of Directors of Abbott 
(the "Board").

     2.2  AUTHORITY OF THE COMMITTEE.  The Committee will have full authority 
to administer the Plan, including the authority to interpret and construe any 
provision of the Plan, and all rules, regulations and interpretations shall 
be conclusive and binding on all persons.  The Committee has sole 
responsibility for selecting Participants, establishing performance 
objectives, setting award targets, and determining award amounts.

     2.3  DELEGATION BY THE COMMITTEE.  The Committee from time to time may 
delegate the performance of certain ministerial functions in connection with 
the Plan, such as the keeping of records, to such person or persons as the 
Committee may select.  The cost of administration of the Plan will be paid by 
Abbott.


SECTION 3.  ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION

     3.1  ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION.  Eligibility for participation in 
the Plan shall be limited to senior officers of Abbott and its subsidiaries. 
Participants in the Plan will be determined annually by the Committee from 
those senior officers eligible to participate in the Plan.


SECTION 4.  PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES

     4.1  PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES.  The Plan's performance objectives (the 
"Performance Objectives") shall be determined with reference to Abbott's 
consolidated net earnings prepared in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles.

     4.2  INDIVIDUAL BASE AWARD ALLOCATION--DEFINED.  The base award 
allocation for the Chief Executive Officer, if a Participant for such fiscal 
year, shall be .0015 of the consolidated net earnings of Abbott for that 
fiscal year.  The base award allocation for the Chief Operating Officer, if a 
Participant for such fiscal year, shall be .0010 of the consolidated net 
earnings of Abbott for that fiscal year.  The base award allocation for any 
other Participant shall be .00075 of the consolidated net earnings of Abbott 
for that fiscal year.  Each such base award will be increased by interest, at 
prevailing market rates, accrued on awards deferred or paid to grantor 
trusts.

<PAGE>

SECTION 5.  FINAL AWARDS

     5.1  FINAL AWARD ALLOCATION.  As soon as practical after the close of 
each fiscal year, a Participant's final award allocation will be determined 
solely on the basis of the Performance Objectives.  In determining a 
Participant's final award allocation, the Committee will have the discretion 
to reduce but not increase a Participant's base award allocation (as 
increased by the last sentence of Section 4.2), provided that a Participant's 
individual performance will be considered by the Committee in exercising that 
discretion.

     5.2  PAYMENT OF AWARDS.  A Participant's final award allocation will be 
paid or deferred in the manner and at the time(s) established by the 
Committee.


SECTION 6.  DURATION, AMENDMENT, AND TERMINATION

    6.1  DURATION OF THE PLAN.  The Plan shall commence on the Effective 
Date, as described in Section 1.1 hereof, and shall remain in effect until 
terminated by the Board.

    6.2  AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.  The Board, in its sole discretion, may 
modify or amend any or all of the provisions of the Plan at any time and, 
without notice, may suspend or terminate it entirely.  However, no such 
modification may, without the consent of the Participant, reduce the right of 
a Participant to a payment or distribution to which the Participant is 
entitled by reason of an outstanding award allocation.


SECTION 7.  SUCCESSORS

     7.1  OBLIGATIONS.  All obligations of Abbott under the Plan with respect 
to awards granted hereunder shall be binding on any successor to Abbott, 
whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect 
purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of 
the business and/or assets of Abbott.

NOTE: For the purpose of calculating this ratio, (i) earnings have been 
      calculated by adjusting net earnings for taxes on earnings; interest 
      expense; capitalized interest cost, net of amortization; minority 
      interest; and the portion of rentals representative of the interest 
      factor, (ii) the Company considers one-third of rental expense to be 
      the amount representing return on capital, and (iii) fixed charges 
      comprise total interest expense, including capitalized interest and 
      such portion of rentals.
