Note 1 - Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and footnote
disclosures normally included in audited financial statements. However, in the
opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments)
necessary to present fairly the results of operations, financial position and
cash flows have been made. It is suggested that these statements be read in
conjunction with the financial statements included in Abbott's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1999.

Note 3 - Taxes on Earnings

Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective tax rates. The
effective tax rates are less than the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate
principally due to the domestic dividend exclusion and tax incentive grants
related to subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic,
Ireland, and the Netherlands.

Note 4 - Litigation and Environmental Matters

Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings including numerous
antitrust suits and investigations in connection with the pricing of
prescription pharmaceuticals. These suits and investigations allege that various
pharmaceutical manufacturers have conspired to fix prices for prescription
pharmaceuticals and/or to discriminate in pricing to retail pharmacies by
providing discounts to mail-order pharmacies, institutional pharmacies and HMOs
in violation of state and federal antitrust laws. The suits have been brought on
behalf of individuals and retail pharmacies and name both Abbott and certain
other pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmaceutical wholesalers and at least
one mail-order pharmacy company as defendants. The cases seek treble damages,
civil penalties, and injunctive and other relief. Abbott has filed or intends to
file a response to each of the remaining complaints denying all substantive
allegations.

In addition, there are several lawsuits and one investigation pending in
connection with the sales of HYTRIN. These suits and the investigation allege
that Abbott violated state or federal antitrust laws and, in some cases,
unfair competition laws by signing separate agreements with Geneva
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Zenith Laboratories, Inc. Those agreements related
to pending patent infringement lawsuits between Abbott and the two companies.
Some of the suits also allege that Abbott violated various state or federal
laws by filing frivolous patent infringement lawsuits to protect HYTRIN from
generic competition. The cases seek treble damages, civil penalties and other
relief. Abbott has filed or intends to file a response to each of the
complaints denying all substantive allegations.

Abbott has also been identified as a potentially responsible party for
investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States
and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating
potential contamination at a number of Company-owned locations.

Abbott expects that within the next year, legal proceedings will occur that
may result in a change in the estimated reserves recorded by Abbott. While it
is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending claims, proceedings,
investigations and remediation activities with certainty, management is of
the opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a material
adverse effect on Abbott's financial position, cash flows, or results of
operations.

The matters above are discussed more fully in Note 14 to the financial
statements included in Abbott's Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is

Note 5  - U.S. Food and Drug Administration Consent Decree

In November 1999, Abbott reached agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to have a consent decree entered to settle issues involving
Abbott's diagnostics manufacturing operations in Lake County, Ill. The decree
requires Abbott to ensure its diagnostics manufacturing processes in Lake
County, Ill., conform with the FDA's current Quality System Regulation. The
decree allows for the continued manufacture and distribution of medically
necessary diagnostic products made in Lake County, Ill. However, Abbott is
prohibited from manufacturing or distributing certain diagnostic products
until Abbott ensures the processes in its Lake County, Ill., diagnostics
manufacturing operations conform with the current Quality System Regulation.
Under the terms of the consent decree, among other actions, Abbott has
submitted to the FDA a proposed master compliance and validation plan to
ensure its processes conform with the current Quality System Regulation. The
decree requires Abbott to ensure its facilities are in conformance with the
current Quality System Regulation within one year from the date of the
consent decree. The consent decree allows Abbott to export diagnostic
products and components for sale and distribution outside the United States
if they meet the export requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act.

Note 8 -- Sale of Agricultural Products Business

On January 20, 2000, Abbott sold its agricultural products business to
Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd., resulting in a $46 million gain recorded in the
first quarter 2000. In addition, under the terms of the agreement, upon
Sumitomo achieving a specified sales milestone, an additional $80 to $90
million would be due to Abbott. This could occur as early as the second
quarter of 2000. Under the transaction, Sumitomo acquired research and
development, sales, marketing, and support operations for Abbott's entire
line of naturally occurring biopesticides, plant growth regulators and other
products for agriculture, public health and forestry. Bulk active ingredient
manufacturing rights were retained by Abbott. For the full year 1999, Abbott
recorded approximately $102 million in sales from this business.

</TABLE>

(a) Percentage changes are based on unrounded numbers.

(b) In 2000, management of the cardiovascular medicine franchise was transferred
from the Pharmaceutical segment to the Hospital segment. Net sales for 1999 have
been restated to reflect this reclassification.

Worldwide sales for the first quarter reflect primarily unit growth. Excluding
the negative effect of the relatively stronger U.S. dollar, sales increased 2.8
percent over the first quarter 1999. Pharmaceutical segment sales decreased
primarily due to volume shortfalls for HYTRIN. Diagnostics segment sales
decreased primarily due to the effect of the consent decree as discussed in
Note 5 and due to the negative effect of the relatively stronger U.S. Dollar.
Excluding exchange, Diagnostics and International segment sales increased 1.9
and 6.3 percent, respectively. Diluted earnings per common share for the
quarter rose to 44 cents, up 2.3 percent from 43 cents a year ago. Net earnings
increased 3.6 percent to $693 million, from $669 million in the first quarter
of 1999.

In late 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suspended its
approval of the release of production lots of Abbott's pharmaceutical product
ABBOKINASE due to Current Good Manufacturing Practice concerns raised by the
FDA following inspections of Abbott and its raw material supplier. On December
10, 1999, Abbott met with the FDA to review Abbott's plan for the qualification
of new raw materials and reinitiation of manufacturing. In the future, Abbott
will sell only ABBOKINASE that is manufactured with new raw materials that meet
the FDA's criteria. Abbott cannot predict, however, whether it will be
successful in qualifying new raw material sources or the effect of this matter
on future sales of ABBOKINASE. It is anticipated, however, that sales of
ABBOKINASE will resume after 2000. In 1999, sales of ABBOKINASE were
approximately $47 million, all of which were recorded in the first quarter.

In August 1999, Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. began shipments of generic
HYTRIN in the United States, which has adversely impacted Abbott's HYTRIN
sales. Full year U.S sales of HYTRIN amounted to $466 million in 1999. For
the first quarter 2000, U.S. Sales of HYTRIN were $34 million.

As a result of the consent decree entered into with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration in 1999, as discussed in Note 5, Abbott is prohibited from
manufacturing or distributing certain diagnostic products until Abbott ensures
the processes in its Lake County, Ill., diagnostics manufacturing operations
conform with the current Quality System Regulation. The consent decree resulted
in a one-time charge of $168 million in 1999. In addition, Abbott estimates that
2000 sales may be negatively impacted up to $250 million and earnings per share
may be negatively impacted up to 10 cents per share.

Gross profit margin (sales less cost of products sold, including freight and
distribution expenses) was 55.4 percent for the 2000 first quarter, compared to
56.1 percent for the 1999 first quarter. This decrease was primarily due to
unfavorable product mix, primarily lower sales of pharmaceuticals.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

(continued)

Research and development expenses for the first quarter 2000 increased 19.2
percent over the comparable 1999 period and includes charges relating to several
research and development collaboration agreements entered into in the first
quarter 2000. The majority of research and development expenditures continues to
be concentrated on pharmaceutical and diagnostic products.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter 2000
increased 6.5 percent over the comparable 1999 period, due primarily to
increased selling and marketing support for new and existing products.

SALE OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS BUSINESS

On January 20, 2000, Abbott sold its agricultural products business to
Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd., resulting in a $46 million gain recorded in the
first quarter 2000. In addition, under the terms of the agreement, upon
Sumitomo achieving a specified sales milestone, an additional $80 to $90
million would be due to Abbott. This could occur as early as the second
quarter of 2000. Under the transaction, Sumitomo acquired research and
development, sales, marketing, and support operations for Abbott's entire
line of naturally occurring biopesticides, plant growth regulators and other
products for agriculture, public health and forestry. Bulk active ingredient
manufacturing rights were retained by Abbott. For the full year 1999, Abbott
recorded approximately $102 million in sales from this business.

INTEREST (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET

Net interest expense decreased in 2000 due primarily to a lower level of
borrowings as a result of the termination of the common share purchase program.

TAXES ON EARNINGS

The effective income tax rate was 27.0 percent in 2000 and 28.0 percent in
1999. The tax rate for 2000 was reduced primarily due to the domestic
dividend exclusion.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AT MARCH 31, 2000 COMPARED WITH
DECEMBER 31, 1999

Net cash from operating activities for the first quarter 2000 totaled $380
million. Abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue
to approximate or exceed Abbott's capital expenditures and cash dividends.

Abbott has maintained its favorable bond ratings (AAA by Standard & Poor's
Corporation and Aa1 by Moody's Investors Service) and continues to have readily
available financial resources, including unused domestic lines of credit of
$2.505 billion at March 31, 2000. These lines of credit support domestic
commercial paper borrowing arrangements.

Abbott may issue up to $521 million of securities in the future under a
registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in
1999. Of the $521 million, Abbott may issue up to $271 million either in the
form of debt securities or common shares without par value. The remaining $250
million may only be issued in the form of debt securities.

LEGISLATIVE ISSUES

Abbott's primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial
government regulation. Abbott expects debate to continue at both the federal and
the state levels over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for
health care products and services. Abbott believes that if legislation is
enacted, it could have the effect of reducing prices, or reducing the rate of
price increases for medical products and services. International operations are
also subject to a significant degree of government regulation. It is not
possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in
general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more
complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, in the
Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is available upon request.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARD

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities." This statement requires the recognition of the fair
value of derivatives as either assets or liabilities. The statement is effective
for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. Adoption of the provisions of
this statement will not have a material effect on the financial statements of
Abbott.

PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 -- A CAUTION CONCERNING
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward-looking statements or
projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject
to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially
from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and
other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Exhibit 99.1
to the Annual Report on Form 10-K.

PART II.    OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, including
those described below.

             In its 1999 Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission
Form 10-K (the "1999 Form 10-K"), Abbott reported that two lawsuits were
pending involving Abbott's patents for divalproex sodium. Three additional
lawsuits have been filed. On March 9, 2000, after having been notified that
Andrx Corporation had filed an abbreviated new drug application to market a
generic divalproex sodium, Abbott filed a patent infringement lawsuit against
Andrx Corporation, Andrx Pharmaceutical, and Andrx Pharmaceutical, L.L.C. in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The
defendants have filed a motion to dismiss this complaint. On April 14, 2000,
Abbott filed patent infringement lawsuits against these three Andrx companies
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida and
against Andrx L.L.C. in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Virginia.

         As of April 14, 2000, 17 antitrust lawsuits and one antitrust
investigation involving Abbott's patents for terazosin hydrochloride, a drug
that Abbott sells under the trademark Hytrin-Registered Trademark-, were
pending. The final patent infringement lawsuit involving Abbott's patents for
terazosin hydrochloride was resolved during the first quarter of 2000. As
previously reported, Abbott sued Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Mylan")
alleging patent infringement. Mylan contended that Abbott's patent which
covers their version of terazosin hydrochloride is invalid and unenforceable.
On October 4, 1999, Mylan's motion in the appellate court for Summary
Affirmance was granted. In February 2000, the United States Supreme Court
denied Abbott's petition for a writ of certiorari.

              In its 1999 Form 10-K, Abbott reported that 13 lawsuits were
pending relating to Abbott's agreements with Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
("Geneva") and Zenith Laboratories, Inc. ("Zenith") regarding terazosin
hydrochloride. During the first quarter of 2000, two of these lawsuits, SCAFANI
V. ABBOTT and VALENTINE V. ABBOTT, were removed from state court to the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. In addition, four
new lawsuits were filed. Three of these new lawsuits are pending in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Florida: on January 19, 2000,
William Mednick filed a lawsuit on behalf of himself and others; on January 27,
2000, Clarence Reid filed a lawsuit on behalf of himself and others; and, on
April 7, 2000, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama filed a lawsuit on behalf
of itself and others. The plaintiffs in the REID and MEDNICK lawsuits allege
Abbott violated antitrust and/or consumer protection laws and seek actual
damages, treble damages, civil penalties and other relief. The plaintiffs in the
BLUE CROSS case allege Abbott violated federal racketeering statutes and seek
unspecified damages. The BLUE CROSS case purports to be a class action.

<PAGE>

Finally, on April 10, 2000, Merit Aid Pharmacy filed a lawsuit on behalf of
itself and others in San Diego Superior Court, San Diego, California, alleging
Abbott violated antitrust laws and seeking actual damages, treble damages,
civil penalties and other relief.

         Abbott also reported that the Federal Trade Commission was
conducting an investigation regarding Abbott's agreements with Geneva and
Zenith. On March 13, 2000, Abbott and the Federal Trade Commission entered
into a consent agreement regarding this matter which has been placed in the
public record for comments.

           In its 1999 Form 10-K, Abbott reported that eighteen lawsuits,
including five derivative lawsuits, were pending relating to Abbott's alleged
noncompliance with the Food and Drug Administration's Quality System
Regulation at Abbott's Diagnostics Division facilities in Lake County,
Illinois. During the first quarter of 2000, the plaintiff in SEINFELD V.
ABBOTT filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Illinois, where it was consolidated with the three other
shareholder derivative lawsuits that were already pending in that court as IN
RE ABBOTT LABORATORIES DERIVATIVE SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION and then voluntarily
dismissed his lawsuit that was pending in Illinois state court. The fifth
shareholder derivative suit was filed by Craig Heneghan and Marjory Motiaytis
in the Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, Lake County,
Illinois. On April 6, 2000, the Lake County Circuit Court granted Abbott's
motion to stay the Heneghan/Motiaytis lawsuit until the shareholder
derivative suits pending in federal court are decided. One new case relating
to the alleged regulatory noncompliance was filed in the first quarter of
2000. On February 7, 2000, Lena Gallagher sued Abbott and Miles White,
Abbott's Chief Executive Officer, claiming the defendants violated Sections
10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 by allegedly
misrepresenting or omitting material information about the alleged regulatory
noncompliance. The complaint, which was filed in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Illinois, purports to be a class action on
behalf of purchasers of ALZA Corporation stock between June 22, 1999 and
November 1, 1999, and seeks unspecified monetary damages and relief.

         The United States Department of Justice is investigating the
marketing and sales practices of TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. for
leuprolide acetate depot suspension (a drug TAP markets as Lupron
Depot-Registered Trademark-). Various state and federal agencies including the
Office of the Inspector General, the United States Department of Justice and
the Texas Attorney General, are also investigating the pricing practices of
TAP with respect to Lupron Depot and/or of Abbott with respect to certain
other Medicare and Medicaid reimbursable products. These investigations seek
to determine whether these practices resulted in any violations of civil
and/or criminal laws, including the Federal False Claims Act and the
Anti-Kickback Act, or fraud in connection with the Medicare and/or Medicaid
reimbursement paid to third parties. Abbott owns 50 percent of TAP.

         While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending claims,
proceedings, and investigations with certainty, management is of the opinion
that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.

                                   ARTICLE II

                                  SHAREHOLDERS

     SECTION 1. ANNUAL MEETING; TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS, NOMINATION OF
DIRECTORS. The annual meeting of the shareholders shall be held in the month of
April in each year on such date and at such time as the Board of Directors shall
provide. The meeting shall be held for the purpose of electing Directors and for
the transaction of such other business as is properly brought before the meeting
in accordance with these By-Laws. If the election of Directors shall not be held
on the day designated for any annual meeting, or at any adjournment thereof, the
Board of Directors shall cause the election to be held at a meeting of the
shareholders as soon thereafter as conveniently may be.

     To be properly brought before the meeting, business must be either (a)
specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at
the direction of the Board of Directors, (b) otherwise properly brought before
the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (c) otherwise
properly brought before the meeting by a shareholder. In addition to any other
applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an annual
meeting by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof
in writing to the Secretary. To be timely, a shareholder's notice must be
delivered to or mailed and received at the principal office of the Corporation,
not earlier than October 1 nor later than the first business day of January
immediately prior to the date of the meeting; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the
event that the date of such meeting is not in the month of April and less than
sixty-five days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is
given or made to shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so
received not later than the close of business on the fifteenth day following the
day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such
public disclosure was made, whichever first occurs. A shareholder's notice to
the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the shareholder proposes to
bring before the annual meeting (i) a brief

description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and
the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name
and record address of the shareholder proposing such business, (iii) the class
and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the
shareholder and (iv) any material interest of the shareholder in such business.

     Notwithstanding anything in these By-Laws to the contrary, no business
shall be conducted at the annual meeting except in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 1, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing in this
Section 1 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any shareholder of any
business properly brought before the annual meeting.

     The Chairman of an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine
and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the
meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1, and if he should so
determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and such business not properly
brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.

     Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures
shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election
to the Board of Directors of the Corporation at the annual meeting may be made
at such annual meeting of shareholders by or at the direction of the Board of
Directors, by any nominating committee or person appointed by the Board of
Directors, or by any shareholder of the Corporation entitled to vote for the
election of directors at such meeting who complies with the notice procedures
set forth in this Section 1. Such nominations, other than those made by or at
the direction of the Board of Directors or by a committee or person appointed by
the Board of Directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to
the Secretary. To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered to or
mailed and received at the principal office of the Corporation not earlier than
October 1 nor later than the first business day of January immediately prior to
the date of the meeting; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event that the date of
such meeting is not in the month of April and less than sixty-five days' notice
or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to
shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so received not
later than the close of business on the fifteenth day following the day on which
such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was
made, whichever first occurs. Such shareholder's notice to the Secretary shall
set forth: (a) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for
election or re-election as a director, (i) the name, age, business address and
residence address of the person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of
the person, (iii) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the
Corporation which are beneficially owned by the person and (iv) any other
information relating to the person that is required to be disclosed in
solicitations for proxies for election of directors pursuant to Regulation 14A
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and (b) as to the
shareholder giving the notice, (i) the name and record address of such
shareholder and (ii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are
beneficially owned by such shareholder. The Corporation may require any proposed
nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the
Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as

<PAGE>

BY-LAWS

director of the Corporation. No person shall be eligible for election as a
director of the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures
set forth herein.

     The Chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and
declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the
foregoing procedure, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the
meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.

     SECTION 2. SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of the shareholders may be
called by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President,
the Board of Directors or by the holders of not less than one-fifth of all the
outstanding shares entitled to vote on the matter for which the meeting is
called.

     SECTION 3. PLACE OF MEETING. The Board of Directors may designate any
place, either within or without the State of Illinois, as the place of meeting
for any annual meeting or for any special meeting called by the Board of
Directors. If no designation is made, or if a special meeting be otherwise
called, the place of meeting shall be the principal office of the Corporation in
the State of Illinois.

     SECTION 4. NOTICE OF MEETINGS. Written notice stating the place, day and
hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered not less than ten
nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting, or in the cases of a
merger, consolidation, share exchange, dissolution or sale, lease or exchange of
assets not less than twenty nor more than sixty days before the meeting, either
personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board, the
Chief Executive Officer, the President, or the Secretary or the persons calling

mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United
States mail, addressed to the shareholder at his or her address as it appears on
the records of the Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid.

     SECTION 5. FIXING RECORD DATE. For the purpose of determining shareholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders, or shareholders
entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination
of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors of the
Corporation may fix in advance a date as the record date for any such
determination of shareholders, such date in any case to be not more than sixty
days and, for a meeting of shareholders, not less than ten days, or in the case
of a merger, consolidation, share exchange, dissolution or sale, lease or
exchange of assets not less than twenty days, immediately preceding such
meeting.

     SECTION 6. VOTING LISTS. The Secretary shall make, or cause to have made,
within twenty days after the record date for a meeting of shareholders or ten
days before such meeting, whichever is earlier, a complete list of the
shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting, arranged in alphabetical order,
with the address of and the number of shares held by each, which list, for a
period of ten days prior to such meeting, shall be kept on file at the
registered office of the

<PAGE>

BY-LAWS

Corporation and shall be subject to inspection by any shareholder and to copying
at the shareholder's expense, at any time during usual business hours. Such list
shall also be produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting and
shall be subject to the inspection of any shareholder during the whole time of
the meeting. The original share ledger or transfer book, or a duplicate thereof
kept in this State, shall be prima facie evidence as to who are the shareholders
entitled to examine such list or share ledger or transfer book or to vote at any
meeting of shareholders.

     SECTION 7. QUORUM. A majority of the outstanding shares of the Corporation
entitled to vote on a matter, represented in person or by proxy, shall
constitute a quorum for consideration of such matter at a meeting of
shareholders. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of
the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on a matter shall be
the act of the shareholders, unless the vote of a greater number or voting by
classes is required by The Business Corporation Act of 1983 or the Articles of
Incorporation, as in effect on the date of such determination. If a quorum is
not present, a majority of the shares of the Corporation entitled to vote on a
matter and represented in person or by proxy at such meeting may adjourn the
meeting from time to time without further notice.

     SECTION 8. PROXIES. A shareholder may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise
act for the shareholder by delivering a valid appointment to the person so
appointed or such person's agent; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, no shareholder may name
more than three persons as proxies to attend and to vote the shareholder's
shares at any meeting of shareholders. Without limiting the manner in which a
shareholder may appoint such a proxy pursuant to these By-Laws, the following
shall constitute valid means by which a shareholder may make such an
appointment:

     (a)  A shareholder may sign a proxy appointment form. The shareholder's
          signature may be affixed by any reasonable means, including, but not
          limited to, by facsimile signature.

     (b)  A shareholder may transmit or authorize the transmission of a
          telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission;
          provided that any such transmission must either set forth or be
          submitted with information from which it can be determined that the
          telegram, cablegram, or other electronic transmission was authorized
          by the shareholder. If it is determined that the telegram, cablegram,
          or other electronic transmission is valid, the inspectors or, if there
          are no inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall
          specify the information upon which they relied.

No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of eleven months from the date
thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy. Each proxy continues in full
force and effect until revoked by the person appointing the proxy prior to the
vote pursuant thereto, except as otherwise provided by law. Such revocation may
be effected by a writing delivered to the secretary of the Corporation stating
that the proxy is revoked or by a subsequent delivery of a valid proxy by, or

<PAGE>

BY-LAWS

by the attendance at the meeting and voting in person by the person appointing
the proxy. The dates of the proxy shall presumptively determine the order of
appointment.

     SECTION 9. VOTING OF SHARES. Each outstanding share, regardless of class,
shall be entitled to one vote in each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of
shareholders and, in all elections for Directors, every shareholder shall have
the right to vote the number of shares owned by such shareholder for as many
persons as there are Directors to be elected, or to cumulate such votes and give
one candidate as many votes as shall equal the number of Directors multiplied by
the number of such shares or to distribute such cumulative votes in any
proportion among any number of candidates; provided that, vacancies on the Board
of Directors may be filled as provided in Section 9, Article III of these
By-Laws. A shareholder may vote either in person or by proxy.

     SECTION 10. VOTING OF SHARES BY CERTAIN HOLDERS. Shares of this Corporation
held by the Corporation in a fiduciary capacity may be voted and shall be
counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares entitled to vote
at any given time.

     Shares registered in the name of another corporation, domestic or foreign,
may be voted by any officer, agent, proxy or other legal representative
authorized to vote such shares under the law of incorporation of such
corporation.

     Shares registered in the name of a deceased person, a minor ward or a
person under legal disability may be voted by his or her administrator,
executor, or court appointed guardian, either in person or by proxy without a
transfer of such shares into the name of such administrator, executor, or court
appointed guardian. Shares registered in the name of a trustee may be voted by
him or her, either in person or by proxy.

     Shares registered in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver,
and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by such
receiver without the transfer thereof into his or her name if authority so to do
is contained in an appropriate order of the court by which such receiver was
appointed.

     A shareholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such
shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, and
thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred.

     SECTION 11. VOTING BY BALLOT. Voting on any question or in any election may
be viva voce unless the presiding officer shall order that voting be by ballot.

     SECTION 12. INSPECTORS OF ELECTION. The Board of Directors in advance of
any meeting of shareholders may appoint inspectors to act at such meeting or any
adjournment thereof. If inspectors of election are not so appointed, the officer
or person acting as chairman at any such meeting may, and on the request of any
shareholder or his proxy, shall make such appointment. In case any person
appointed as inspector shall fail to appear or to act, the vacancy

<PAGE>

BY-LAWS

may be filled by appointment made by the Board of Directors in advance of the
meeting or at the meeting by the officer or person acting as chairman.

     Such inspectors shall ascertain and report the number of shares represented
at the meeting, based upon their determination of the validity and effect of
proxies; count all votes and report the results; and do such other acts as are
proper to conduct the election and voting with impartiality and fairness to all
the shareholders.

     Each report of an inspector shall be in writing and signed by him or her or
by a majority of them if there be more than one inspector acting at such
meeting. If there is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be
the report of the inspectors. The report of the inspector or inspectors on the
number of shares represented at the meeting and the results of the voting shall
be prima facie evidence thereof.

                                   ARTICLE III

                                    DIRECTORS

expiration of a Director's term, he or she shall continue to serve until the
next meeting of shareholders at which Directors are elected. Directors need not
be residents of Illinois or shareholders of the Corporation.

     SECTION 3. REGULAR MEETINGS. A regular annual meeting of the Board of
Directors shall be held without other notice than this By-Law, immediately
after, and at the same place as, the annual meeting of shareholders. Other
regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at the principal office
of the Corporation on the second Friday of every month at 9:00 a.m. without
other notice than this By-Law. The Board of Directors may provide, by
resolution, for the holding of the regular monthly meetings at a different time
and place, either within or without the State of Illinois, or for the omission
of the regular monthly meeting altogether. Where the Board of Directors has, by
resolution, changed or omitted regular meetings, no other notice than such
resolution shall be given.

     SECTION 4. SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may
be called by or at the request of the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman of the
Executive Committee, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, or of any four
Directors. The persons authorized to call special meetings of the Board of
Directors may fix any place, either within or without the State of Illinois, as
the place for holding any special meeting of the Board of Directors.

     SECTION 5. NOTICE. Notice of any special meeting shall be given: (i) at
least one day prior thereto if the notice is given personally or by an
electronic transmission, (ii) at least two business days prior thereto if the
notice is given by having it delivered by a third party entity that provides
delivery services in the ordinary course of business and guarantees delivery of
the notice to the Director no later than the following business day, and (iii)
at least seven days prior thereto if the notice is given by mail. For this
purpose, the term "electronic transmission" may include, but shall not be
limited to, a telex, facsimile, or other electronic means. Notice shall be
delivered to the Director's business address and/or telephone number and shall
be deemed given upon electronic transmission, upon delivery to the third party
delivery service, or upon being deposited in the United States mail with postage
thereon prepaid. Any Director may waive notice of any meeting by signing a
written waiver of notice either before or after the meeting. Attendance of a
Director at any meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting,
except where a Director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting
to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors need to be specified in the
notice or waiver of notice of such meeting.

     SECTION 6. QUORUM. A majority of the number of Directors fixed by these
By-Laws shall constitute a quorum for transaction of business at any meeting of
the Board of Directors; provided, that if less than a majority of such number of
Directors are present at said meeting, a majority of the Directors present may
adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice.

     SECTION 7. MANNER OF VOTING. The act of the majority of the Directors
present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board
of Directors.

     SECTION 8. INFORMAL ACTION BY DIRECTORS. Any action required to be taken at
a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any other action which may be taken at a
meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof, may be taken without a
meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be
signed by all of the Directors entitled to vote with respect to the subject
matter thereof, or by all the members of such committee, as the case may be.

     The consent shall be evidenced by one or more written approvals, each of
which sets forth the action taken and bears the signature of one or more
Directors. All the approvals evidencing the consent shall be delivered to the
Secretary of the Corporation to be filed in the corporate records. The action
taken shall be effective when all the Directors have approved the consent unless
the consent specifies a different effective date.

     Any such consent signed by all the Directors or all the members of a
committee shall have the same effect as a unanimous vote.

     SECTION 9. VACANCIES. Any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors and
any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of
Directors, may be filled by

<PAGE>

BY-LAWS

election at an annual meeting or at a special meeting of shareholders called for
that purpose. A Director elected to fill a vacancy shall serve until the next
annual meeting of shareholders. A majority of Directors then in office may also
fill one or more vacancies arising between meetings of shareholders by reason of
an increase in the number of Directors or otherwise, and any Director so
selected shall serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders, provided
that at no time may the number of Directors selected to fill vacancies in this
manner during any interim period between meetings of shareholders exceed 33-1/3
per cent of the total membership of the Board of Directors.

     SECTION 10. PRESUMPTION OF ASSENT. A Director of the Corporation who is
present at a meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof at which
action on any corporate matter is taken is conclusively presumed to have
assented to the action taken unless his or her dissent is entered in the minutes
of the meeting or unless he or she files his or her written dissent to such
action with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting before the
adjournment thereof or forwards such dissent by registered or certified mail to
the Secretary of the Corporation immediately after the adjournment of the
meeting. Such right to dissent shall not apply to a Director who voted in favor
of such action.

     SECTION 11. APPOINTMENT OF AUDITORS. Upon the recommendation of the Audit
Committee, the Board of Directors shall appoint annually a firm of independent
public accountants as auditors of the Corporation. Such appointment shall be
submitted to the shareholders for ratification at the Annual Meeting next
following such appointment. Should the holders of a majority of the shares
represented at the meeting fail to ratify the appointment of any firm as
auditors of the Corporation, or should the Board of Directors for any reason
determine that such appointment be terminated, the Board of Directors shall
appoint another firm of independent public accountants to act as auditors of the
Corporation and such appointment shall be submitted to the shareholders for
ratification at the Annual or Special Shareholders Meeting next following such
appointment.

                   CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES AND THEIR TRANSFER

     SECTION 1. CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES. Certificates representing shares of the

Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or an Executive Vice
President, and shall be countersigned by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary
and shall be sealed with the seal, or a facsimile of the seal, of the

the Corporation, or any officer or employee of the Transfer Agent or Registrar
who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon such
certificate ceases to be an Officer of the Corporation, or an officer or
employee of the Transfer Agent or Registrar before such certificate is issued,

Officer of the Corporation, or the officer or employee of the Transfer Agent or
Registrar had not ceased to be such at the date of its issue. Each certificate
representing shares shall state: that the Corporation is organized under the
laws of the State of Illinois; the name of the person to whom issued; the number
and class of shares; and the designation of the series, if any, which such
certificate represents. Each certificate shall be consecutively numbered or
otherwise identified. The name of the person to whom the shares represented
thereby are issued, with the number of shares and date of issue, shall be
entered on the books of the Corporation. All certificates surrendered to the
Corporation for transfer shall be canceled, and no new certificate shall be
issued in replacement until the former certificate for a like number of shares
shall have been surrendered and canceled, except in the case of lost, destroyed
or mutilated certificates.

     SECTION 2. TRANSFER AGENT AND REGISTRAR. The Board of Directors may from
time to time appoint such Transfer Agents and Registrars in such locations as it
shall determine, and may, in its discretion, appoint a single entity to act in
the capacity of both Transfer Agent and Registrar in any one location.

     SECTION 3. TRANSFER OF SHARES. Transfers of shares of the Corporation shall
be made only on the books of the Corporation at the request of the holder of
record thereof or of his attorney, lawfully constituted in writing, and on
surrender for cancellation of the certificate for such shares. The person in
whose name shares stand on the books of the Corporation shall be deemed the
owner thereof for all purposes as regards the Corporation.

     SECTION 4. LOST, DESTROYED OR MUTILATED CERTIFICATES. In case of lost,
destroyed or mutilated certificates, duplicate certificates shall be issued to
the person claiming the loss, destruction or mutilation, provided:

     (a)  That the claimant furnishes an affidavit stating the facts of such
          loss, destruction or mutilation so far as known to him or her and
          further stating that the affidavit is

               certificate or certificates;

          upon receipt of a bond, with one or more sureties, in the amount to be
          determined by the party giving such approval; or

     (b)  that issuance of the said duplicate certificate or certificates is
          approved by the Board of Directors upon such terms and conditions as
          it shall determine.

                                   ARTICLE VII

of rental expense to be the amount representing return on capital, and (iii)

and such portion of rentals.
