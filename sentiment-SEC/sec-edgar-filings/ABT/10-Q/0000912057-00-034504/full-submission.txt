Note 1 - Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and footnote
disclosures normally included in audited financial statements. However, in the
opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments)
necessary to present fairly the results of operations, financial position and
cash flows have been made. It is suggested that these statements be read in
conjunction with the financial statements included in Abbott's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1999.

Note 3 - Taxes on Earnings

Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective tax rates. The
effective tax rates are less than the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate
principally due to the domestic dividend exclusion applicable to earnings of
TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. and tax incentive grants related to
subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Ireland, the
Netherlands and Italy.

Note 4 - Litigation and Environmental Matters

Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings including numerous
antitrust suits and investigations in connection with the pricing of
prescription pharmaceuticals. These suits and investigations allege that various
pharmaceutical manufacturers have conspired to fix prices for prescription
pharmaceuticals and/or to discriminate in pricing to retail pharmacies by
providing discounts to mail-order pharmacies, institutional pharmacies and HMOs
in violation of state and federal antitrust laws. The suits have been brought on
behalf of individuals and retail pharmacies and name both Abbott and certain
other pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmaceutical wholesalers and at least
one mail-order pharmacy company as defendants. The cases seek treble damages,
civil penalties, and injunctive and other relief. Abbott has filed or intends to
file a response to each of the remaining complaints denying all substantive
allegations.

In addition, there are several lawsuits and one investigation pending in
connection with the sales of HYTRIN. These suits and the investigation allege
that Abbott violated state or federal antitrust laws and, in some cases, unfair
competition laws by signing settlement agreements with Geneva Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. and Zenith Laboratories, Inc. Those agreements related to pending patent
infringement lawsuits between Abbott and the two companies. Some of the suits
also allege that Abbott violated various state or federal laws by filing
frivolous patent infringement lawsuits to protect HYTRIN from generic
competition. The cases seek treble damages, civil penalties and other relief.
Abbott has filed or intends to file a response to each of the complaints denying
all substantive allegations.

The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the marketing and sales
practices of TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. ("TAP") for LUPRON. In
addition, various state and federal agencies are investigating the pricing
practices of TAP with respect to LUPRON and/or of Abbott with respect to
certain other Medicare and Medicaid reimbursable products.

Abbott has also been identified as a potentially responsible party for
investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States
and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating
potential contamination at a number of Company-owned locations.

Abbott expects that within the next year, legal proceedings will occur that may
result in a change in the estimated reserves recorded by Abbott. While it is not
feasible to predict the outcome of such pending claims, proceedings,
investigations and remediation activities with certainty, management is of the
opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse
effect on Abbott's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.

The matters above are discussed more fully in Note 14 to the financial
statements included in Abbott's Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is available
upon request.

Note 5 - U.S. Food and Drug Administration Consent Decree

In November 1999, Abbott reached agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to have a consent decree entered to settle issues involving
Abbott's diagnostics manufacturing operations in Lake County, Ill. The decree
requires Abbott to ensure its diagnostics manufacturing processes in Lake
County, Ill., conform with the FDA's current Quality System Regulation. The
decree allows for the continued manufacture and distribution of medically
necessary diagnostic products made in Lake County, Ill. However, Abbott is
prohibited from manufacturing or distributing certain diagnostic products until
Abbott ensures the processes in its Lake County, Ill., diagnostics manufacturing
operations conform with the current Quality System Regulation. Under the terms
of the consent decree, among other actions, Abbott has submitted to the FDA a
proposed master compliance and validation plan to ensure its processes conform
with the current Quality System Regulation. The decree requires Abbott to ensure
its facilities are in conformance with the current Quality System Regulation
within one year from the date of the consent decree. The consent decree allows
Abbott to export diagnostic products and components for sale and distribution
outside the United States if they meet the export requirements of the Federal
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

certain employee benefits are sold to segments at predetermined rates which
approximate cost. Remaining costs, if any, are not allocated to revenue
segments. The following segment information has been prepared in accordance with
the internal accounting policies of Abbott, as described above, and may not be
presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Note 8 -- Sale of Agricultural Products Business

On January 20, 2000, Abbott sold its agricultural products business to
Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd., resulting in a $46 million gain recorded in the
first quarter 2000. In the second quarter, upon Sumitomo achieving a sales
milestone, Abbott recorded an additional $92 million gain. Under the
transaction, Sumitomo acquired research and development, sales, marketing,
and support operations for Abbott's entire line of naturally occurring
biopesticides, plant growth regulators and other products for agriculture,
public health and forestry. Bulk active ingredient manufacturing rights were
retained by Abbott. For the full year 1999, Abbott recorded approximately
$102 million in sales from this business.

</TABLE>
(a)  Percentage changes are based on unrounded numbers.
(b)  In 2000, management of the cardiovascular medicine franchise was
transferred from the Pharmaceutical segment to the Hospital segment. Net sales
for 1999 have been restated to reflect this transfer.

Worldwide sales for the second quarter and first six months reflect primarily
unit growth. Excluding the negative effect of the relatively stronger U.S.
dollar, sales increased 4.8 percent for the second quarter and 3.8 percent for
the first six months, respectively, over the comparable 1999 periods.
Diagnostics segment sales decreased for the first six months primarily due to
the effect of the consent decree as discussed in Note 5 and due to the negative
effect of the relatively stronger U.S. Dollar. Excluding exchange, Diagnostics
segment sales increased 2.3 percent for the first six months. Diluted earnings
per common share increased 7.3 percent and 4.8 percent in the second quarter and
first six months, respectively, over the same periods in 1999. Net earnings
increased 6.2 percent and 4.9 percent in the second quarter and first six months
2000, respectively, over the comparable 1999 periods.

In August 1999, Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. began shipments of generic HYTRIN
in the United States, which has adversely impacted Abbott's HYTRIN sales. Full
year U.S. sales of HYTRIN amounted to $466 million in 1999. For the first six
months 2000, U.S. sales of HYTRIN were $69 million.

As a result of the consent decree entered into with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration in 1999, as discussed in Note 5, Abbott is prohibited from
manufacturing or distributing certain diagnostic products until Abbott
ensures the processes in its Lake County, Ill., diagnostics manufacturing
operations conform with the current Quality System Regulation. The consent
decree resulted in a one-time charge of $168 million in the third quarter of
1999. In addition, Abbott estimates that 2000 sales may be negatively
impacted up to $250 million and earnings per share may be negatively impacted
up to 10 cents per share.

In 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration suspended its approval of the
release of production lots of Abbott's pharmaceutical product ABBOKINASE due
to Current Good Manufacturing Practice concerns. It is anticipated that sales
of ABBOKINASE will resume after 2000. In 1999, sales of ABBOKINASE were
approximately $47 million, all of which were recorded in the first quarter.

Gross profit margin (sales less cost of products sold, including freight and
distribution expenses) was 54.6 percent for the second quarter 2000, compared to
56.6 percent for the second quarter 1999. First six months 2000 gross profit
margin was 55.0 percent, compared to 56.4 percent for the first six months 1999.
These decreases were primarily due to unfavorable product mix.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
(continued)

Research and development expenses for the second quarter 2000 and first six
months 2000 increased 13.7 percent and 16.3 percent, respectively, over the
comparable 1999 periods, and include charges relating to several research and
development collaboration agreements entered into in the first six months 2000.
The majority of research and development expenditures continues to be
concentrated on pharmaceutical and diagnostic products.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter 2000 and
first six months 2000 increased 5.1 percent and 5.8 percent, respectively, over
the comparable 1999 periods, due primarily to increased selling and marketing
support for new and existing products.

SALE OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS BUSINESS

On January 20, 2000, Abbott sold its agricultural products business to
Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd., resulting in a $46 million gain recorded in the
first quarter 2000. In the second quarter, upon Sumitomo achieving a sales
milestone, Abbott recorded an additional $92 million gain. Under the
transaction, Sumitomo acquired research and development, sales, marketing,
and support operations for Abbott's entire line of naturally occurring
biopesticides, plant growth regulators and other products for agriculture,
public health and forestry. Bulk active ingredient manufacturing rights were
retained by Abbott. For the full year 1999, Abbott recorded approximately
$102 million in sales from this business.

INTEREST (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET

Net interest expense decreased in both the second quarter and first six months
2000, due primarily to a lower level of borrowings.

TAXES ON EARNINGS

The effective income tax rate was 27.0 percent in 2000 and 28.0 percent in
1999. The tax rate for 2000 was reduced primarily due to the domestic
dividend exclusion applicable to the increased earnings of TAP Pharmaceutical
Products Inc.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AT JUNE 30, 2000 COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 1999

Net cash from operating activities for the first six months 2000 totaled
$1.648 billion. Abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to
continue to approximate or exceed Abbott's capital expenditures and cash
dividends.

Abbott has maintained its favorable bond ratings (AAA by Standard & Poor's
Corporation and Aa1 by Moody's Investors Service) and continues to have readily
available financial resources, including unused domestic lines of credit of
$1.505 billion at June 30, 2000. These lines of credit support domestic
commercial paper borrowing arrangements.

Abbott may issue up to $518 million of securities in the future under a
registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in
1999. Of the $518 million, Abbott may issue up to $268 million either in the
form of debt securities or common shares without par value. The remaining $250
million may only be issued in the form of debt securities.

In June 2000, Abbott's Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 25
million of Abbott's common shares. Abbott purchased and retired 1,352,000 shares
during this period at a cost of $56.8 million. As of June 30, 2000, an
additional 23,648,000 shares may be purchased in future periods.

LEGISLATIVE ISSUES

Abbott's primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial
government regulation. Abbott expects debate to continue at both the federal and
the state levels over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for
health care products and services. Abbott believes that if legislation is
enacted, it could have the effect of reducing prices, or reducing the rate of
price increases for medical products and services. International operations are
also subject to a significant degree of government regulation. It is not
possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in
general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more
complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, in the
Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is available upon request.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARD

The Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") has issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements, as amended on June 26, 2000. SAB No. 101 provides the SEC staff's
views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to selected
revenue recognition issues, and is effective beginning in the fourth quarter
of 2000. Abbott is evaluating the effects of implementation, if any, on its
financial statements.

PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 -- A CAUTION CONCERNING
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS20

Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward-looking statements or
projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject
to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially
from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and
other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Exhibit 99.1
to the Annual Report on Form 10-K.

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

          Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, including
those described below.

          In its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2000,
Abbott reported five lawsuits were pending involving Abbott's patents for
divalproex sodium, a drug that Abbott sells under the trademark
Depakote-Registered Trademark-, including the patent infringement lawsuits
Abbott filed against Andrx Corporation, Andrx Pharmaceutical, and Andrx
Pharmaceutical, L.L.C. in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Illinois and in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Florida and the patent infringement lawsuit Abbott filed against
Andrx L.L.C. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia. During the quarterly period ended June 30, 2000, the lawsuit
pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois was transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Florida and consolidated with the case pending in that court. The
lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of Virginia also will be transferred to the United States District Court for
the Southern District of Florida and consolidated with the case that is
pending in that court.

          In its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2000,
Abbott reported 17 lawsuits and one antitrust investigation were pending
involving Abbott's patents for terazosin hydrochloride, a drug that Abbott
sells under the trademark Hytrin-Registered Trademark-. During the quarterly
period ended June 30, 2000, three additional lawsuits were filed. All three
of these lawsuits relate to Abbott's agreements with Geneva Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. ("Geneva") and/or Zenith Laboratories, Inc. ("Zenith") which are
described in Abbott's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999.
On June 8, 2000, Martin Bernstein filed a lawsuit against Abbott and Geneva
in state court in Oakland County, Michigan alleging that Abbott's agreement
with Geneva violated the Michigan Antitrust Reform Act. On April 27, 2000,
Willie O'Neal filed a lawsuit against Abbott, Geneva, and Zenith in state
court in Jefferson County, Alabama alleging that Abbott's agreement with
Geneva and Zenith violated the Illinois Fraud and Deceptive Trade Practices
Act. On May 26, 2000, Steven Daniels filed a lawsuit against Abbott in state
court in Orange County, California alleging that Abbott's agreements with
Geneva and Zenith violated the California Cartwright Act and/or the Unfair
Trade Practice Act. Each of these cases purports to be a class action and has
been conditionally transferred to the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Florida. Abbott has filed or intends to file a response
to each of the complaints denying all substantive allegations.

          In its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999,
Abbott reported that 116 antitrust lawsuits were pending in federal court and
14 were pending in state court involving Abbott's pricing of pharmaceutical
products. As of July 21, 2000, as a result of settlements, 114 antitrust
suits were pending in federal court. During the quarterly period ended June
30, 2000, the Alabama Supreme Court dismissed the case that had been pending
in the Alabama state court in Clarke County, Alabama and a new case was
brought in Clarke County on behalf of Alabama consumers by the Alabama
District Attorney. Abbott has filed a response denying all substantive
allegations of the complaint.

                                       12
<PAGE>

          In its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2000,
Abbott reported 19 cases were pending relating to Abbott's alleged
noncompliance with the Federal Food and Drug Administration's Quality System
Regulation at Abbott's Diagnostics Division facilities in Lake County,
Illinois. These include 13 cases consolidated as IN RE ABBOTT LABORATORIES
SECURITIES LITIGATION, 4 cases consolidated as IN RE ABBOTT LABORATORIES
DERIVATIVE SHAREHOLDER, and GALLAGHER V. ABBOTT. Abbott has moved to dismiss
these 18 cases.

          While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending
claims, proceedings, and investigations with certainty, management is of the
opinion that their ultimate dispositions should not have a material adverse
effect on Abbott's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.

2. ADMINISTRATION. The Program will be administered by a committee (the
"Committee") of at least two persons which shall be either the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company or such other committee
comprised entirely of persons who are both: (i) "disinterested persons" as
defined in Rule 16b-3 of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and (ii)
"outside directors" as defined under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, or any successor provision; as the Board of Directors may
from time to time designate. The Committee shall interpret the Program,
prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating thereto and make all
other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the
Program. A majority of the members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum
and all determinations of the Committee shall be made by a majority of its
members. Any determination of the Committee under the Program may be made
without notice of meeting of the Committee by a writing signed by all of the
Committee members. The Committee may, from time to time, delegate any or all of
its duties, powers and authority to any officer or officers of the Company,
except to the extent such delegation would be inconsistent with Rule 16b-3 of
the Securities and Exchange Commission or other applicable law, rule or
regulation. The Chief Executive Officer of the Company may, on behalf of the
Committee, grant stock options and restricted stock awards under the Program,
other than to persons subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. All such grants by the Chief Executive Officer must be reported to, and
ratified by, the Committee within twelve months of the grant date but, if
ratified, shall be effective as of the grant date.

3. PARTICIPANTS. Participants in the Program will consist of such officers and
other employees of the Company and its subsidiaries as the Committee in its sole
discretion may designate from time to time to receive Benefits hereunder. The
Committee's designation of a participant in any year shall not require the
Committee to designate such person to receive a Benefit in any other year. The
Committee shall consider such factors as it deems pertinent in selecting
participants and in determining the type and amount of their respective
Benefits, including without limitation (i) the financial condition of the
Company; (ii) anticipated profits for the current or future years; (iii)
contributions of participants to the profitability and development of the
Company; (iv) prior awards to participants; and (v) other compensation provided
to participants. Non-Employee Directors shall also be participants in the
Program solely for purposes of receiving Restricted Stock Awards under paragraph
13 and Non-qualified Stock Options under paragraph 14. The term "Non-Employee
Director" shall mean a member of the Board of Directors who is not a full-time
employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

4. TYPES OF BENEFITS. Benefits under the Program may be granted in any one or a
combination of (a) Incentive Stock Options; (b) Non-qualified Stock Options; (c)
Stock Appreciation Rights; (d) Limited Stock Appreciation Rights; (e) Restricted
Stock Awards; (f) Performance Awards; and (g) Foreign Qualified Benefits, all as
described below.

5. SHARES RESERVED UNDER THE PROGRAM. There is hereby reserved for issuance
under the Program: (i) an aggregate of Five Million (5,000,000) common shares;
plus (ii) an authorization for each calendar year (the "Annual Authorization")
for the years 1996 through 1999, of seven-tenths of one percent (0.7%) of the
total common shares of the Company issued and outstanding as of the first day of
such calendar year and for the years from and including 2000, one and a half
percent (1.5%) of the total common shares of the Company

<PAGE>
                                      -2-

issued and outstanding as of the first day of such calendar year; which may be
newly issued or treasury shares. The shares hereby reserved are in addition to
the shares previously reserved under the Company's 1981 Incentive Stock Program,
1986 Incentive Stock Program and 1991 Incentive Stock Program (the "Prior
Programs"). Any common shares reserved for issuance under the Prior Programs in
excess of the number of shares as to which options or other Benefits have been
awarded on the date of shareholder approval of this Program, plus any such
shares as to which options or other Benefits granted under the Prior Programs
may lapse, expire, terminate or be canceled after such date, shall also be
reserved and available for issuance in connection with Benefits under this
Program. Any common shares reserved under the Program for any calendar year
under an Annual Authorization as to which options or other Benefits have not
been awarded as of the end of such calendar year shall be available for issuance
in connection with Benefits granted in subsequent years.

          If there is a lapse, expiration, termination or cancellation of any
Benefit granted hereunder without the issuance of shares or payment of cash
thereunder, or if shares are issued under any Benefit and thereafter are
reacquired by the Company pursuant to rights reserved upon the issuance thereof,
or shares are reacquired pursuant to the payment of the purchase price of shares
under stock options by delivery of other common shares of the Company, the
shares subject to or reserved for such Benefit, or so reacquired, may again be
used for new options, rights or awards of any sort authorized under this
Program; provided, however, that in no event may the number of common shares
issued under this Program, and not reacquired by the Company pursuant to rights
reserved upon the issuance thereof or pursuant to the payment of the purchase
price of shares under stock options by delivery of other common shares of the
Company, exceed the total number of shares reserved for issuance hereunder.

6. INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS. Incentive Stock Options will consist of options to
purchase common shares at purchase prices not less than One Hundred percent
(100%) of the Fair Market Value of such common shares on the date of grant. An
Incentive Stock Option will not be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10)
years from the date such option is granted. In the event of termination of
employment for any reason other than retirement, disability or death, the right
of the optionee to exercise an Incentive Stock Option shall terminate upon the
earlier of the end of the original term of the option or three (3) months after
the optionee's last day of work for the Company and its subsidiaries. In the
event of termination of employment due to retirement or disability, or if the
optionee should die while employed, the right of the optionee or his or her
successor in interest to exercise an Incentive Stock Option shall terminate upon
the end of the original term of the option. If the optionee should die within
three (3) months after termination of employment for any reason other than
retirement or disability, the right of his or her successor in interest to
exercise an Incentive Stock Option shall terminate upon the earlier of the end
of the original term of the option or three (3) months after the date of such
death. To the extent the aggregate fair market value (determined as of the time
the Option is granted) of the common shares with respect to which any Incentive
Stock Option is exercisable for the first time by any individual during any
calendar year (under all option plans of the Company and its subsidiary
corporations) exceeds $100,000, the excess shall be treated as a Non-qualified
Stock Option. An Incentive Stock Option shall be exercisable as determined by
the Committee, but in no event earlier than six (6) months from its grant date.

7. NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS. Non-qualified Stock Options will consist of
options to purchase common shares at purchase prices not less than One Hundred
percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of such common shares on the date of
grant. A Non-qualified Stock Option will not be exercisable after the expiration
of ten (10) years from the date such option is granted. In the event of
termination of employment for any reason other than retirement, disability or
death, the right of the optionee to exercise a Non-qualified Stock Option shall
terminate upon the earlier of the end of the original term of the option or
three (3) months after the optionee's last day of work for the Company and its
subsidiaries. In the event of termination of employment due to retirement or
disability, or if the optionee should die while employed, the right of the
optionee or his or her successor in interest to exercise a Non-qualified Stock
Option shall terminate upon the end of the original term of the option. If the
optionee should die within three (3) months after termination of

<PAGE>
                                      -3-

employment for any reason other than retirement or disability, the right of his
or her successor in interest to exercise a Non-qualified Stock Option shall
terminate upon the earlier of the end of the original term of the option or
three (3) months after the date of such death. A Non-qualified Stock Option
shall be exercisable as determined by the Committee, but in no event earlier
than six (6) months from its grant date.

8. STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS. The Committee may, in its discretion, grant a
Stock Appreciation Right to the holder of any stock option granted hereunder or
under the Prior Programs. Such Stock Appreciation Rights shall be subject to
such terms and conditions consistent with the Program as the Committee shall
impose from time to time, including the following:

               (a)  A Stock Appreciation Right may be granted with respect to a
          stock option at the time of its grant or at any time thereafter up to
          six (6) months prior to its expiration.

               (b)  Stock Appreciation Rights will permit the holder to
          surrender any related stock option or portion thereof which is then
          exercisable and to elect to receive in exchange therefor cash in an
          amount equal to:

                    (i)  The excess of the Fair Market Value on the date of such
               election of one common share over the option price multiplied by

                    (ii) The number of shares covered by such option or portion
               thereof which is so surrendered.

               (c)  A Stock Appreciation Right granted to a participant who is
          subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
          amended, may be exercised only after six (6) months from its grant
          date (unless such exercise would not affect the exemption under Rule
          16b-3 of the Securities and Exchange Commission).

               (d)  A Stock Appreciation Right may be granted to a participant
          regardless of whether such participant has been granted a Limited
          Stock Appreciation Right with respect to the same stock option.
          However, a Stock Appreciation Right may not be exercised during any
          period that a Limited Stock Appreciation Right with respect to the
          same stock option may be exercised.

               (e)  In the event of the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right,
          the number of shares reserved for issuance hereunder shall be reduced
          by the number of shares covered by the stock option or portion thereof
          surrendered.

9. LIMITED STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS. The Committee may, in its discretion,
grant a Limited Stock Appreciation Right to the holder of any stock option
granted hereunder or under the Prior Programs. Such Limited Stock Appreciation
Rights shall be subject to such terms and conditions consistent with the Program
as the Committee shall impose from time to time, including the following:

               (a)  A Limited Stock Appreciation Right may be granted with
          respect to a stock option at the time of its grant or at any time
          thereafter up to six (6) months prior to its expiration.

               (b)  A Limited Stock Appreciation Right will permit the holder to
          surrender any related stock option or portion thereof which is then
          exercisable and to receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount
          equal to:

                    (i)  The excess of the Fair Market Value on the date of such
               election of one common share over the option price multiplied by

<PAGE>
                                      -4-

                    (ii) The number of shares covered by such option or portion
               thereof which is so surrendered.

               (c)  A Limited Stock Appreciation Right granted to a participant
          who is subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
          as amended, may be exercised only after six (6) months from its grant
          date (unless such exercise would not affect the exemption under Rule
          16b-3 of the Securities and Exchange Commission) and only during the
          sixty (60) day period commencing on the later of: (i) the day
          following the date of a Change in Control; or (ii) the first date on
          which such exercise would be exempt under Rule 16b-3 of the Securities
          and Exchange Commission.

               (d)  A Limited Stock Appreciation Right may be granted to a
          participant regardless of whether such participant has been granted a
          Stock Appreciation Right with respect to the same stock option.

               (e)  In the event of the exercise of a Limited Stock Appreciation
          Right, the number of shares reserved for issuance hereunder shall be
          reduced by the number of shares covered by the stock option or portion
          thereof surrendered.

10. RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS. Restricted Stock Awards will consist of common
shares transferred to participants without other payment therefor as additional
compensation for their services to the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
Restricted Stock Awards granted under this paragraph 10 shall be satisfied from
the Company's available treasury shares. Restricted Stock Awards shall be
subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee determines appropriate,
including, without limitation, restrictions on the sale or other disposition of
such shares and rights of the Company to reacquire such shares upon termination
of the participant's employment within specified periods. Subject to such other
restrictions as are imposed by the Committee, the common shares covered by a
Restricted Stock Award granted to a participant who is subject to Section 16 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, may be sold or otherwise
disposed of only after six (6) months from the grant date of the award (unless
such sale would not affect the exemption under Rule 16b-3 of the Securities and
Exchange Commission). No more than ten percent (10%) of the total number of
shares available for grant in any calendar year may be issued as Restricted
Stock Awards under paragraphs 10 and 13 in that year.

11. PERFORMANCE AWARDS. Performance Awards in the form of Performance Units
or Performance Shares may be granted to any participant in the Program.
Performance Units shall consist of monetary awards which may be earned in
whole or in part if the Company achieves certain goals established by the
Committee over a designated period of time. Performance Shares shall consist
of common shares or awards denominated in common shares which may be earned
in whole or in part if the Company achieves certain goals established by the
Committee over a designated period of time. The goals established by the
Committee shall be based on any one, or combination of, earnings per share,
return on equity, return on assets, total shareholder return, net operating
income, cash flow, increase in revenue, economic value added, increase in
share price or cash flow return on investment. Partial achievement of the
goal(s) may result in a payment or vesting corresponding to the degree of
achievement. Payment of an award earned may be in cash or in common shares or
in a combination of both, and may be made when earned, or may be vested and
deferred, as the Committee in its sole discretion determines. The maximum
amount which may be granted under all Performance Awards for any one year for
any one participant shall be Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000). This limit
shall be applied to Performance Shares by multiplying the number of
Performance Shares granted by the fair market value of one common share on
the date of the award. During the term of the Program, no more than 5 million
shares of Abbott common stock may be granted in the form of Performance Units
and no more than 5 million shares of Abbott common stock may be granted in
the form of Performance Shares. This paragraph 11 is intended to comply with
the performance-based compensation requirements of Section 162(m) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and shall be interpreted in
accordance with the rules and regulations thereunder.

12. FOREIGN QUALIFIED BENEFITS. Benefits under the Program may be granted to
such employees of the Company and its subsidiaries who are residing in foreign
jurisdictions as the Committee in its sole discretion

<PAGE>
                                      -5-

may determine from time to time. The Committee may adopt such supplements to the
Program as may be necessary to comply with the applicable laws of such foreign
jurisdictions and to afford participants favorable treatment under such laws;
provided, however, that no Benefit shall be granted under any such supplement
with terms or conditions which are inconsistent with the provisions as set forth
under the Program.

13. RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS.

               (a)  Each year, on the date of the annual shareholders meeting,
          each person who is elected a Non-Employee Director at the annual
          shareholders meeting shall be awarded both: (i) a Restricted Stock
          Award covering a number of common shares with a fair market value on
          the date of the award closest to, but not in excess of, an amount
          equal to six times the monthly fee in effect under Section 3.1 of the
          Abbott Laboratories Non-Employee Director's Fee Plan on the date of
          the award and (ii) in the years 1996 through 2005, a Restricted Stock
          Award covering a number of common shares with a fair market value on
          the date of the award closest to, but not in excess of, Twenty-Two
          Thousand Dollars ($22,000) for awards made in years 1996 through 2000
          and Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) for awards made in years
          2001 through 2005.

               (b)  ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES. As soon as practicable following
          the date of the award the Company shall issue certificates
          ("Certificates") to the Non-Employee Director receiving the award,
          representing the number of common shares covered by the award. Each
          Certificate shall bear a legend describing the restrictions on such
          shares imposed by this paragraph 13.

               (c)  RIGHTS. Upon issuance of the Certificates, the directors in
          whose names they are registered shall, subject to the restrictions of
          this paragraph 13, have all of the rights of a shareholder with
          respect to the shares represented by the Certificates, including the
          right to vote such shares and receive cash dividends and other
          distributions thereon.

               (d)  RESTRICTED PERIOD. The shares covered by awards granted
          under this paragraph 13 may not be sold or otherwise disposed of
          within six (6) months following their grant date (unless such sale
          would not affect the exemption under Rule 16b-3 of the Securities and
          Exchange Commission) and in addition shall be subject to the
          restrictions of this paragraph 13 for a period (the "Restricted
          Period") commencing with the date of the award and ending on the
          earliest of the following events:

                    (i)  The date the director terminates or retires from the
               Board;

                    (ii) The date the director dies; or

                    (iii) The date of occurrence of a Change in Control (as
               defined in paragraph 20(c)).

               (e)  RESTRICTIONS. All shares covered by awards granted under
          this paragraph 13 shall be subject to the following restrictions
          during the Restricted Period:

                    (i)  The shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred,
               pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of.

                    (ii) Any additional common shares of the Company or other
               securities or property issued with respect to shares covered by
               awards granted under this paragraph 13 as a result of any stock
               dividend, stock split or reorganization, shall be subject to the
               restrictions and other provisions of this paragraph 13.

                    (iii) A director shall not be entitled to receive any shares
               prior to completion of

<PAGE>
                                      -6-

               all actions deemed appropriate by the Company to comply with
               federal or state securities laws and stock exchange requirements.

               (f)  Except in the event of conflict, all provisions of the
          Program shall apply to this paragraph 13. In the event of any conflict
          between the provisions of the Program and this paragraph 13, this
          paragraph 13 shall control. Those provisions of paragraph 17 which
          authorize the Committee to declare outstanding restricted stock awards
          to be vested and to amend or modify the terms of Benefits shall not
          apply to awards granted under this paragraph 13. Restricted Stock
          Awards granted under this paragraph 13 shall be satisfied from the
          Company's available treasury shares.

14. NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS.

               (a)  Each Non-Employee Director may elect to receive any or all
          of his or her fees earned during the second half of 1996 and each
          subsequent calendar year under Section 3 of the Abbott Laboratories
          Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan (the "Directors' Fee Plan") in the
          form of Non-qualified Stock Options under this Section 14. Each such
          election shall be irrevocable, and must be made in writing and filed
          with the Secretary of the Company by December 31, 1995 (for fees
          earned in the second half of 1996) and (for fees earned in subsequent
          calendar years) by June 30 of the calendar year preceding the calendar
          year in which such fees are earned (or such later date as may be
          permissible under Rule 16b-3 of the Securities and Exchange
          Commission, but in no event later than December 31 of such preceding
          calendar year).

               (b)  A Non-Employee Director may file a new election each
          calendar year applicable to fees earned in the immediately succeeding
          calendar year. If no new election or revocation of a prior election is
          received by June 30 of any calendar year (or such later date as may be
          permissible under paragraph (a)), the election, if any, in effect for
          such calendar year shall continue in effect for the immediately
          succeeding calendar year. Any election made under this Section 14
          shall take precedence over any election made by the director for the
          same period, under the Directors' Fee Plan, to the extent necessary to
          resolve any conflict between such elections. If a director does not
          elect to receive his or her fees in the form of Non-qualified Stock
          Options, the fees due such director shall be paid or deferred as
          provided in the Directors' Fee Plan and any applicable election
          thereunder by the director.

               (c)  The number of common shares covered by each Non-qualified
          Stock Option granted in any year under this Section 14 shall be
          determined based on an independent appraisal for such year of the
          intrinsic value of options granted hereunder and the amount of fees
          covered by the director's election for such year. The number of common
          shares covered by options granted in 1996 (as determined under this
          procedure) shall be the number of whole shares equal to (i) the
          product of three (3) times the amount of fees which the director has
          elected under paragraph (a) to receive in the form of Non-qualified
          Stock Options, divided by (ii) One Hundred percent (100%) of the Fair
          Market Value of one common share on the grant date. Any fraction of a
          share shall be disregarded, and the remaining amount of the fees
          corresponding to such option shall be paid as provided in the
          Directors' Fee Plan and any applicable election thereunder by the
          director.

               (d)  Effective on October 10, 1997, each Non-qualified Stock
          Option due a director under this Section 14 prior to the 1998 annual
          shareholders meeting shall be granted on October 10, 1997 at a
          purchase price equal to One Hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market
          Value of the common shares covered by such option on the grant date.
          Effective with the 1998 Annual Shareholders Meeting, each
          Non-qualified Stock Option due a director under this Section 14 shall
          be granted annually, on the date of the annual shareholders meeting,
          at a purchase price equal to One Hundred percent (100%) of the Fair
          Market Value of the common shares covered by such option on the grant
          date. Each such option shall be immediately exercisable and
          nonforfeitable, and shall not be

<PAGE>
                                      -7-

          exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date it is
          granted. Each such option shall contain provisions allowing payment of
          the purchase price and, to the extent permitted, any taxes due on
          exercise, by delivery of other common shares of the Company (or, in
          the case of the payment of taxes, by withholding of shares).

               (e)  All Non-qualified Stock Options granted under this Section
          14 prior to October 10, 1997, shall be immediately exercisable and
          nonforfeitable, and shall not be exercisable after the expiration of
          ten (10) years from the date granted.

15. NONTRANSFERABILITY. Except as provided by the Committee, each stock option
and stock appreciation right granted under this Program shall not be
transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and
shall be exercisable, during the participant's lifetime, only by the participant
or the participant's guardian or legal representative.

16. OTHER PROVISIONS. The award of any Benefit under the Program may also be
subject to other provisions (whether or not applicable to the Benefit awarded to
any other participant) as the Committee determines appropriate, including,
without limitation, provisions for the purchase of common shares under stock
options in installments, provisions for the payment of the purchase price of
shares under stock options by delivery of other common shares of the Company
having a then market value equal to the purchase price of such shares,
restrictions on resale or other disposition, such provisions as may be
appropriate to comply with federal or state securities laws and stock exchange
requirements and understandings or conditions as to the participant's employment
in addition to those specifically provided for under the Program.

          In the case of a participant who is subject to Section 16(a) and 16(b)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Committee may, at any time, add such
conditions and limitations to any Benefit granted to such participant, or any
feature of any such Benefit, as the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems
necessary or desirable to comply with Section 16(a) or 16(b) and the rules and
regulations thereunder or to obtain any exemption therefrom.

          A participant may pay the purchase price of shares under stock options
by delivery of a properly executed exercise notice together with a copy of
irrevocable instructions to a broker to deliver promptly to the Company the
amount of sale or loan proceeds to pay the purchase price. To facilitate the
foregoing, the Company may enter into agreements for coordinated procedures with
one or more brokerage firms.

          The Committee may, in its discretion and subject to such rules as it
may adopt, permit or require a participant to pay all or a portion of the
federal, state and local taxes, including FICA and medicare withholding tax,
arising in connection with the following transactions: (a) the exercise of a
Non-qualified Stock Option; (b) the lapse of restrictions on common shares
received as a Restricted Stock Award; or (c) the receipt or exercise of any
other Benefit; by (i) having the Company withhold common shares, (ii) tendering
back common shares received in connection with such Benefit or (iii) delivering
other previously acquired common shares of the Company having a fair market
value approximately equal to the amount to be withheld.

          The Committee may grant stock options under the Program (and, for
stock options granted prior to shareholder approval of this Program, under the
Company's 1991 Incentive Stock Program) that provide for the grant of
replacement stock options if all or any portion of the purchase price or taxes
incurred in connection with the exercise, are paid by delivery (or, in the case
of payment of taxes, by withholding of shares) of other common shares of the
Company. The replacement stock option shall cover the number of common shares
surrendered to pay the purchase price, plus the number of shares surrendered or
withheld to satisfy the participant's tax liability, shall have an exercise
price equal to One Hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of such
common shares on the date such replacement stock option is granted, shall first
be exercisable six months from the date of grant of the replacement stock option
and shall have an expiration date equal to the expiration date of the original
stock option.

17. TERM OF PROGRAM AND AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION, CANCELLATION OR ACCELERATION OF
BENEFITS. The Program shall continue in effect until terminated by the Board of
Directors of the Company, except that no Incentive Stock Option shall be granted
more than ten (10) years after the date of adoption of this Program. The terms
and conditions applicable to any Benefits may at any time be amended, modified
or canceled by mutual agreement between the Committee and the participant or
such other persons as may then have an interest therein, so long as any
amendment or modification does not increase the number of common shares issuable
under this Program; and provided further, that the Committee may, at any time
and in its sole discretion, declare any or all stock options and stock
appreciation rights then outstanding under this Program or the Prior Programs to
be exercisable and any or all then outstanding Restricted Stock Awards to be
vested, whether or not such options, rights or awards are then otherwise
exercisable or vested. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as provided in
paragraph 22, the Committee shall neither lower the purchase price of any
option granted under the Program nor grant any option under the Program in
replacement of a cancelled option which had previously been granted at a
higer purchase price, without shareholder approval.

18. AMENDMENT TO PRIOR PROGRAMS. No options or other Benefits shall be granted
under the Prior Programs on or after the date of shareholder approval of this
Program.

19. INDIVIDUAL LIMIT ON OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS; AGGREGATE LIMIT
ON INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS. The maximum number of shares with respect to which
Incentive Stock Options, Non-qualified Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights
and Limited Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted to any one participant, in
aggregate in any one calendar year, shall be One Million (1,000,000) shares.
Incentive Stock Options with respect to no more than the lesser of (i)
Seventy-Five Million (75,000,000) shares (plus any shares acquired by the
Company pursuant to payment of the purchase price of shares under incentive
stock options by delivery of other common shares of the Company), or (ii) the
total number of shares reserved under paragraph 5 may be issued under the Plan.

20. TAXES. The Company shall be entitled to withhold the amount of any tax
attributable to any amount payable or shares deliverable under the Program after
giving the person entitled to receive such amount or shares notice as far in
advance as practicable, and the Company may defer making payment or delivery if
any such tax may be pending unless and until indemnified to its satisfaction.

21. DEFINITIONS.

               (a)  FAIR MARKET VALUE. The Fair Market Value of the Company's
          common shares shall be the average of the highest and lowest sales
          prices of such shares as reported on the New York Stock Exchange
          Composite Reporting System for the date as of which the determination
          is to be made or in the absence of reported sales on that date, the
          average of such reported highest and lowest sales prices for the next
          preceding date on which reported sales occurred; provided that, in the
          case of any Limited Stock Appreciation Right (other than a right
          related to an Incentive Stock Option), the Fair Market Value shall be
          the higher of:

                    (i)  The highest daily closing price of the Company's common
               shares during the sixty (60) day period following the Change in
               Control; or

                    (ii) The highest gross price paid or to be paid for the
               Company's common shares in any of the transactions described in
               paragraphs 21(c)(i) and 21(c)(ii).

               (b)  SUBSIDIARY. The term "subsidiary" for all purposes other
          than the Incentive Stock Option provisions in paragraph 6, shall mean
          any corporation, partnership, joint venture or business trust, fifty
          percent (50%) or more of the control of which is owned, directly or
          indirectly, by the Company. For Incentive Stock Option purposes the

          Code Section 424(f).

               (c)  CHANGE IN CONTROL. A "Change in Control" shall be deemed to

                    (i)  The date any entity or person (including a "group" as
               defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of
               1934 (the "Exchange Act")) shall have become the beneficial owner
               of, or shall have obtained voting control over, thirty percent
               (30%) or more of the outstanding common shares of the Company;

                    (ii) The date the shareholders of the Company approve a
               definitive agreement (A) to merge or consolidate the Company with
               or into another corporation, or to merge another corporation into
               the Company, in which the Company is not the continuing or
               surviving corporation or pursuant to which any common shares of
               the Company would be converted into cash, securities of another
               corporation, or other property, other than a merger or
               consolidation of the Company in which holders of common shares
               immediately prior to the merger have the same proportionate
               ownership of common stock of the surviving corporation or its
               parent corporation immediately after the merger as immediately
               before, or (B) to sell or otherwise dispose of substantially all

               of the Board of Directors of the Company within a twelve (12)
               month period unless the nomination for election by the Company's
               shareholders of each new director was approved by the vote of
               two-thirds of the directors then still in office who were in
               office at the beginning of the twelve (12) month period.

(d) DISABILITY. The term "disability" for all purposes of the Program shall mean
the participant's disability as defined in subsection 4.1(a) of the Abbott
Laboratories Extended Disability Plan for twelve (12) consecutive months.

22. ADJUSTMENT PROVISIONS.

               (a)  If the Company shall at any time change the number of
           issued common shares without new consideration to the Company
           (such as by stock dividends or stock splits), the total number of
           shares reserved for issuance under this Program, the individual
           and aggregate limits described in paragraphs 11 and 19, and the
           number of shares that may be granted or issued (as the case may
           be), and the number of shares covered by each outstanding Benefit
           shall be adjusted so that the aggregate consideration payable to
           the Company and the value of each such Benefit shall not be
           changed. The Committee shall also have the right to provide for
           the continuation of Benefits or for other equitable adjustments
           after changes in the Company or in the common shares resulting
           from reorganization, sale, merger, consolidation, spin-off or
           similar occurrence.

               (b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Program, and
          without affecting the number of shares otherwise reserved or available
          hereunder, the Committee may authorize the issuance or assumption of
          Benefits in connection with any merger, consolidation, acquisition of
          property or stock, or reorganization upon such terms and conditions as
          it may deem appropriate.

               (c)  Subject to the six month holding requirements of paragraphs
          6, 7, 8(c), 9(c), 10 and 13(d) but notwithstanding any other provision
          of this Program or the Prior Programs, upon the occurrence of a Change
          in Control:

                    (i)  All stock options then outstanding under this Program
               or the Prior Programs shall become fully exercisable as of the
               date of the Change in Control, whether or not then otherwise
               exercisable;

                    (ii) All Stock Appreciation Rights and Limited Stock
               Appreciation Rights then outstanding shall become fully
               exercisable as of the date of the Change in Control, whether or
               not then otherwise exercisable;

<PAGE>
                                      -10-

                    (iii) All terms and conditions of all Restricted Stock
               Awards then outstanding shall be deemed satisfied as of the date
               of the Change in Control; and

                    (iv) All Performance Awards then outstanding shall be deemed
               to have been fully earned and to be immediately payable, in cash,
               as of the date of the Change in Control.

23. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF PROGRAM. The Board of Directors of the
Company may amend the Program from time to time or terminate the Program at
any time, but no such action shall reduce the then existing amount of any
participant's Benefit or adversely change the terms and conditions thereof
without the participant's consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as
provided in paragraph 22, the Company shall neither lower the purchase price
of any option granted under the Program nor grant any option under the
Program in replacement of a cancelled option which had previously been
granted at a higher purchase price, without shareholder approval. To the
extent required for compliance with Rule 16b-3 of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, paragraph 13 of the Program may not be amended more frequently
than once every six months other than to comport with changes in the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the rules thereunder, and no amendment
of the Program shall result in any Committee member losing his or her status
as a "disinterested person" as defined in Rule 16b-3 of the Securities and
Exchange Commission with respect to any employee benefit plan of the Company
or result in the Program or awards thereunder losing their exempt status
under said Rule 16b-3.

24. SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL. The Program was adopted by the Board of Directors of
the Company on October 13, 1995. The Program and any Benefit granted thereunder
shall be null and void if shareholder approval is not obtained by October 12,
1996.

              ABBOTT LABORATORIES NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS' FEE PLAN

                                    SECTION 1
                                     PURPOSE

     ABBOTT LABORATORIES NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS' FEE PLAN - referred to below as
the "Plan" - has been established by ABBOTT LABORATORIES - referred to below as
the "Company" - to attract and retain as members of its Board of Directors
persons who are not full-time employees of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries but whose business experience and judgment are a valuable asset to
the Company and its subsidiaries.

                                    SECTION 2
                                DIRECTORS COVERED

     As used in the Plan, the term "Director" means any person who is elected to
the Board of Directors of the Company in April, 1962 or at any time thereafter,
and is not a full-time employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

                                    SECTION 3
                            FEES PAYABLE TO DIRECTORS

     3.1  Each Director shall be entitled to a deferred monthly fee of Five
Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) for each calendar month or portion thereof
(excluding the month in which he is first elected a Director) that he holds such
office with the Company.

     3.2  A Director who serves as Chairman of the Executive Committee of the
Board of Directors shall be entitled to a deferred monthly fee of One Thousand
Six Hundred Dollars ($1,600.00) for each calendar month or portion thereof
(excluding the month in which he is first elected to such position) that he
holds such position.

     3.3  A Director who serves as Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Board
of Directors shall be entitled to a deferred monthly fee of Six Hundred
Sixty-Seven Dollars ($667.00) for each calendar month or portion thereof
(excluding the month in which he is first elected to such position) that he
holds such position.

     3.4  A Director who serves as Chairman of the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors shall be entitled to a deferred monthly fee of Six Hundred
Sixty-Seven Dollars ($667.00) for each calendar month or portion thereof
(excluding the month in which he is first elected to such position) that he
holds such position.

     3.5  A Director who serves as Chairman of the Nominations Committee of the
Board of Directors shall be entitled to a deferred monthly fee of Six Hundred
Sixty-Seven Dollars ($667.00) for each calendar month or portion thereof

<PAGE>
                                      -2-

     3.6  A Director who serves as Chairman of any other Committee created by
this Board of Directors shall be entitled to a deferred monthly fee of Six
Hundred Sixty-Seven Dollars ($667.00) for each calendar month or portion thereof
(excluding the month in which he is first elected to such position) that he
holds such position.

     3.7  A Director's Deferred Fee Account shall be credited with interest
annually. During the calendar years 1968 and prior, the rate of interest
credited to deferred fees shall be four (4) percent per annum. During the
calendar years 1969 through 1992, the rate of interest credited to deferred fees
shall be the average of the prime rates being charged by two largest commercial
banks in the City of Chicago as of the end of the month coincident with or last
preceding the date upon which said interest is so credited. During the calendar
years 1993 and subsequent, the rate of interest credited to deferred fees shall
be equal to: (a) the average of the prime rates being charged by the two largest
commercial banks in the City of Chicago as of the end of the month coincident
with or last preceding the date upon which said interest is so credited; plus
(b) two hundred twenty-five (225) basis points. For purposes of the provisions
of the Plan, the term "deferred fees" shall include "deferred monthly fees," and
"deferred meeting fees," and shall also include any such interest credited
thereon.

                                    SECTION 4
                           PAYMENT OF DIRECTORS' FEES

     4.1  A Director's deferred fees earned pursuant to the Plan shall commence
to be paid on the first day of the calendar month next following the earlier of
his death or his attainment of age sixty-five (65) if he is not then serving as
a Director, or the termination of his service as a Director if he serves as a
Director after the attainment of age sixty-five (65); provided that any Director
may, by written notice filed with the Secretary of the Company, elect to receive
current payment of all or any portion of the monthly and meeting fees earned by
him in calendar years subsequent to the calendar year in which he files such
notice (or all or any portion of such fees earned by him in the calendar year he
first becomes a Director, if such notice is filed within 30 days of becoming a
Director), in which case such fees or the portion thereof so designated earned
in such calendar years shall not be deferred but shall be paid quarterly as
earned and no interest shall be credited thereon. Such election may be revoked
or modified by any Director by written notice to the Secretary of the Company as
to fees to be earned by him in calendar years subsequent to the calendar year in
which he files such notice.

     4.2  After a Director's deferred fees shall have commenced to be payable
pursuant to Paragraph 4.1 they shall be payable in annual installments in the
order in which they shall have been deferred (i.e. the deferred fees for the
earliest year of service as a Director will be paid on the date provided for in
Section 4.1, the deferred fees for the next earliest year of service as a
Director will be paid on the anniversary of the payment of the first
installment, etc.).

     4.3  A Director's deferred fees shall continue to be paid until all
deferred fees which he is entitled to receive under the Plan shall have been
paid to him (or, in case of his death, to his beneficiary).

<PAGE>
                                      -3-

     4.4  Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, if a Director's
service as a Director should terminate for any reason within five (5) years
after the date of a Change in Control, the aggregate unpaid balance of such
Director's deferred fees plus all unpaid interest credited thereon, shall be
paid to such Director in a lump sum within thirty (30) days following the date
of such termination.

     4.5  A "Change in Control" shall be deemed to have occurred on the earliest
of the following dates:

     (i)   The date any entity or person (including a "group" as defined in
           Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
           "Exchange Act")) shall have become the beneficial owner of, or
           shall have obtained voting control over thirty percent (30%) or
           more of the outstanding common shares of the Company;

     (ii)  The date the shareholders of the Company approve a definitive
           agreement (A) to merge or consolidate the Company with or into
           another corporation, in which the Company is not the continuing or
           surviving corporation or pursuant to which any common shares of the
           company would be converted into cash, securities or other property
           of another corporation, other than a merger of the Company in which
           holders of common shares immediately prior to the merger have the
           same proportionate ownership of common stock of the surviving
           corporation immediately after the merger as immediately before, or
           (B) to sell or otherwise dispose of substantially all the assets of
           the Company; or

     (iii) The date there shall have been a change in a majority of the Board of
           Directors of the Company within a twelve (12) month period unless the
           nomination for election by the Company's shareholders of each new
           director was approved by the vote of two-thirds of the directors then
           still in office who were in office at the beginning of the twelve
           (12) month period.

     4.6  The provisions of Paragraphs 4.4 and 4.5 and this Paragraph 4.6 may
not be amended or deleted, nor superseded by any other provision of the Plan,
during the period beginning on the date of a Change in Control and ending on the
date five (5) years following such Change in Control.

                                    SECTION 5
                          DIRECTORS' RETIREMENT BENEFIT

     5.1  Effective April 30, 1998, each of the persons serving as a Director on
December 12, 1997 shall be credited with a retirement benefit of $4,167 a month
for 120 months of continuous service and no additional retirement benefits shall
accrue under the Plan. Each of the persons serving as a Director on December 12,
1997 may elect: (a) to have his or her retirement benefit under the Plan treated
as provided in Section 5.2 of the Plan; or (b) to have the present value of that
retirement benefit credited to an unfunded phantom stock account and converted
into phantom stock units based on the closing price of the Company's common
stock on April 30, 1998, with those phantom stock units then being credited with
the same cash and stock dividends, stock splits and other distributions and
adjustments as are paid on the Company's

<PAGE>
                                      -4-

common stock. The phantom stock units shall be payable to the Director in annual
payments commencing on the first day of the calendar month next following the
earlier of the Director's death or termination of service as a Director, in an
amount determined by the closing price of the Company's common stock on the
first business day preceding the payment date. Unless the retirement benefit is
terminated, the annual benefit shall continue to be paid on the anniversary of
the day on which the first such retirement benefit payment was made, until the
benefit has been paid for ten years, or until the death of the Director or
surviving spouse, if earlier. If a Director should die with such benefit still
in effect, prior to receipt of all payments due hereunder, the annual benefit
shall continue to be paid to the surviving spouse of such Director until all
payments due hereunder have been made or until the death of the surviving
spouse, if earlier.

     5.2  Any person serving as a Director on December 12, 1997 who elects to
have his or her retirement benefit paid pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall
receive a monthly benefit equal to $4,167. Payment of the monthly benefit shall
commence on the first day of the calendar month next following the earlier of
the Director's death or termination of service as a Director. Unless the
retirement benefit is terminated, the monthly benefit shall continue to be paid
on the first day of each calendar month thereafter, until the benefit has been
paid for one hundred and twenty (120) months, or until the death of the Director
or surviving spouse, if earlier. If a Director should die with such benefit
still in effect, prior to receipt of all payments due hereunder, the monthly
benefit shall continue to the surviving spouse of such Director until all
payments due hereunder have been made or until the death of the surviving
spouse, if earlier.

     5.3  Directors who retired on or before December 12, 1997 will receive the
form and amount of retirement benefit payable under the terms of the Plan in
effect at the time of their retirement.

     5.4  Each Director who is granted a retirement benefit hereunder shall make
him or herself available for such consultation with the Board of Directors or
any committee or member thereof, as may be reasonably requested from time to
time by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, following such Director's
termination of service as a Director. The Company shall reimburse each such
Director for all reasonable travel, lodging and subsistence expenses incurred by
the Director at the request of the Company in rendering such consultation. The
Company may terminate the retirement benefit if the Director should fail to
render such consultation, unless prevented by disability or other reason beyond
the Director's control.

     5.5  It is recognized that during a Director's period of service as a
Director and as a consultant hereunder, a Director will acquire knowledge of the
affairs of the Company and its subsidiaries, the disclosure of which would be
contrary to the best interests of the Company. Accordingly, the Company may
terminate the retirement benefit if, without the express consent of the Company,
the Director accepts election to the Board of Directors of, acquires a
partnership or proprietary interest in, or renders services as an employee or
consultant to, any business entity which is engaged in substantial competition
with the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

     5.6  An individual will be considered a Director's "surviving spouse" for
purposes of this Section 5 only if the Director and such individual were married
in a religious or civil ceremony recognized under the laws of the state where
the marriage was contracted and the marriage remained legally effective at the

                                    SECTION 6
                        CONVERSION TO COMMON STOCK UNITS

     6.1  Any Director who is then serving as a director may, by written notice
filed with the Secretary of the Company, elect to have all or any portion of
deferred fees previously earned but not yet paid, transferred from the
Director's Deferred Fee Account to a Stock Account maintained on his or her
behalf pursuant to paragraph 9.3. Any election as to a portion of such fees
shall be expressed as a percentage and the same percentage shall be applied to
all such fees regardless of the calendar year in which earned or to all deferred
fees earned in designated calendar years, as specified by the Director. A
Director may make no more than one election under this paragraph 6.l in any
calendar year. All such elections may apply only to deferred fees for which an
election has not previously been made and shall be irrevocable.

     6.2  Any Director may, by written notice filed with the Secretary of the
Company, elect to have all or any portion of deferred fees earned subsequent to
the date such notice is filed credited to a Stock Account established under this
Section 6. Fees covered by such election shall be credited to such account at
the end of each calendar quarter in, or for which, such fees are earned. Such
election may be revoked or modified by such Director, by written notice filed
with the Secretary of the Company, as to deferred fees to be earned in calendar
years subsequent to the calendar year such notice is filed, but shall be
irrevocable as to deferred fees earned prior to such year.

     6.3  Deferred fees credited to a Stock Account under paragraph 6.1 shall be
converted to Common Stock Units by dividing the deferred fees so credited by the
closing price of common shares of the Company on the date notice of election
under paragraph 6.1 is received by the Company (or the next business day, if
there are no sales on such date) as reported on the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Reporting System. Deferred fees credited to a Stock Account under
paragraph 6.2 shall be converted to Common Stock Units by dividing the deferred
fees so credited by the closing price of common shares of the Company as of the
last business day of the calendar quarter for which the credit is made, as
reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Reporting System.

     6.4  Each Common Stock Unit shall be credited with the same cash and stock
dividends, stock splits and other distributions and adjustments as are received
by one common share of the Company. All cash dividends and other cash
distributions credited to Common Stock Units shall be converted to additional
Common Stock Units by dividing each such dividend or distribution by the closing
price of common shares of the Company on the payment date for such dividend or
distribution, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange Composite Reporting
System.

     6.5  The value of the Common Stock Units credited each Director shall be
paid the Director in cash on the dates specified in paragraph 4.2 (or, if
applicable, paragraph 4.4). The amount of each payment shall be determined by
multiplying the Common Stock Units payable on each date specified in paragraph
4.2 (or, if applicable, paragraph 4.4) by the closing price of common shares of
the Company on the day prior to that date (or the next preceding business day if
there are no sales on such date), as reported by the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Reporting System.

                                    SECTION 7
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     7.1  Each Director or former Director entitled to payment of deferred fees
hereunder, from time to time may name any person or persons (who may be named
contingently or successively) to whom any deferred Director's fees earned by him
and payable to him are to be paid in case of his death before he receives any or
all of such deferred Director's fees. Each designation will revoke all prior
designations by the same Director or former Director, shall be in form
prescribed by the Company, and will be effective only when filed by the Director
or former Director in writing with the Secretary of the Company during his
lifetime. If a deceased Director or former Director shall have failed to name a
beneficiary in the manner provided above, or if the beneficiary named by a
deceased Director or former Director dies before him or before payment of all
the Director's or former Director's deferred Directors' fees, the Company, in
its discretion, may direct payment in a single sum of any remaining deferred
Directors' fees to either:

     (a)  any one or more or all of the next of kin (including the surviving
          spouse) of the Director or former Director, and in such proportions as
          the Company determines; or

     (b)  the legal representative or representatives of the estate of the last
          to die of the Director or former Director and his last surviving
          beneficiary.

The person or persons to whom any deceased Director's or former Director's
deferred Directors' fees are payable under this paragraph will be referred to as
his "beneficiary."

     7.2  Establishment of the Plan and coverage thereunder of any person shall
not be construed to confer any right on the part of such person to be nominated
for reelection to the Board of Directors of the Company, or to be reelected to
the Board of Directors.

     7.3  Payment of deferred Directors' fees will be made only to the person
entitled thereto in accordance with the terms of the Plan, and deferred
Directors' fees are not in any way subject to the debts or other obligations of
persons entitled thereto, and may not be voluntarily or involuntarily sold,
transferred or assigned. When a person entitled to a payment under the Plan is
under legal disability or, in the Company's opinion, is in any way incapacitated
so as to be unable to manage his financial affairs, the Company may direct that
payment be made to such person's legal representative, or to a relative or
friend of such person for his benefit. Any payment made in accordance with the
preceding sentence shall be in complete discharge of the Company's obligation to
make such payment under the Plan.

     7.4  Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Company under the
terms of the Plan shall be by affirmative vote of a majority of the members of
the Board of Directors then in office.

                                    SECTION 8
                          AMENDMENT AND DISCONTINUANCE

     While the Company expects to continue the Plan, it must necessarily
reserve, and does hereby reserve, the right to amend or discontinue the Plan at
any time; provided, however, that any amendment or discontinuance of the Plan
shall be prospective in operation only, and shall not affect the payment of any
deferred Directors' fees theretofore earned by any Director, or the conditions
under which any such fees are to be paid or forfeited under the Plan, unless the
Director affected shall expressly consent thereto.

                                    SECTION 9
                       ALTERNATE PAYMENT OF DEFERRED FEES

     9.1  By written notice filed with the Secretary of the Company prior to
calendar years beginning after December 31, 1988 (or, for the calendar year he
first becomes a Director within 30 days of becoming a Director), a Director may
elect to receive all or any portion of his deferred fees earned in such calendar
years in a lump sum in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9. An
election under this subsection 9.1 may be revoked or modified by the Director by
written notice to the Secretary of the Company as to deferred fees earned under
Section 3 in calendar years beginning after the calendar year in which he files
such notice. Any amounts that were deferred for calendar years beginning before
January 1, 1989 shall automatically be paid as provided in this Section 9.

     9.2  If payment of a Director's deferred fees is made pursuant to paragraph
9.1, a portion of such fees shall be paid in cash for the Director directly to a
"Grantor Trust" established by the Director, provided such trust is in a form
which the Company determines to be substantially similar to the trust attached
to this plan as Exhibit A; and the balance of the deferred fees shall be paid in
cash directly to the Director, provided that the payment made directly to the
Director shall approximate the aggregate federal, state and local individual
income taxes attributable to the deferred fees paid pursuant to this paragraph
9.2.

     9.3  The Company will establish and maintain four separate accounts in the
name of each Director, "a Deferred Fee Account", a "Deferred Fee Trust Account",
a "Stock Account" and a "Stock Trust Account". The Deferred Fee Account shall
reflect the deferred fees and interest to be credited to a Director pursuant to
Section 3. The Deferred Fee Trust Account shall reflect any deferred fees paid
in cash to a Director (including amounts paid to a Director's Grantor Trust and
allocated to the deferred account maintained thereunder) pursuant to paragraph
9.2 and any adjustments made pursuant to paragraph 9.4. The Stock Account shall
reflect the deferred fees converted to Common Stock Units pursuant to Section 6
and any adjustments made pursuant to that Section. The Stock Trust Account shall
reflect deferred fees that have been converted to Common Stock Units under
Section 6 and paid in cash to a Director (including amounts paid to a Director's
Grantor Trust and allocated to the stock account maintained thereunder) pursuant
to paragraph 9.2 and any adjustments made pursuant to paragraph 9.5. The
Accounts established pursuant to this paragraph 9.3 are for the convenience of
the administration of the plan and no trust relationship with respect to such
Accounts is intended or should be implied.

                                      -8-

     9.4  As of the end of each calendar year, the Company shall adjust each
Director's Deferred Fee Trust Account as follows:

     (a)  FIRST, charge an amount equal to the product of: (i) any payments made
          to the Director during that year from the deferred account maintained
          under his or her Grantor Trust (other than distributions of trust
          earnings in excess of the Net Interest Accrual authorized by the
          administrator of the trust to provide for the Tax Gross Up under
          paragraph 9.9 below); multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of
          which is the balance in the Director's Deferred Fee Trust Account as
          of the end of the prior calendar year and the denominator of which is
          the balance in the deferred account maintained under the Director's
          Grantor Trust (as determined by the administrator of the trust) as of
          that same date;

     (b)  NEXT, credit an amount equal to the deferred fees that have not been
          converted to Common Stock Units that are paid that year to the
          Director (including the amount paid to the Director's Grantor Trust
          and allocated to the deferred account maintained thereunder) pursuant
          to paragraph 9.2; and

     (c)  FINALLY, credit an amount equal to the Interest Accrual earned for
          that year pursuant to paragraph 9.6.

     9.5  As of the end of each calendar year, the Company shall adjust each
Director's Stock Trust Account as follows:

     (a)  FIRST, charge an amount equal to the product of: (i) any payments made
          to the Director during that year from the stock account maintained
          under his or her Grantor Trust (other than distributions of trust
          earnings authorized by the administrator of the trust to provide for
          the Tax Gross Up under paragraph 9.9 below); multiplied by (ii) a
          fraction, the numerator of which is the balance in the Director's
          Stock Trust Account as of the end of the prior calendar year and the
          denominator of which is the balance in the stock account maintained
          under the Director's Grantor Trust (as determined by the administrator
          of the trust) as of that same date;

     (b)  NEXT, credit an amount equal to the deferred fees that have been
          converted to Common Stock Units that are paid that year to the
          Director (including the amount paid to the Director's Grantor Trust
          and allocated to the stock account maintained thereunder) pursuant to
          paragraph 9.2; and

     (c)  FINALLY, credit an amount equal to the Book Value Adjustments to be
          made for that year pursuant to paragraph 9.6.

     9.6  As of the end of each calendar year, a Director's Deferred Fee Trust
Account shall be credited with interest at the rate described in paragraph 3.7.
Any amount so credited shall be referred to as a Director's "Interest Accrual".
As of that same date, a Director's Stock Trust Account shall be adjusted as
provided in paragraph 6.4, and shall also be adjusted to reflect the

<PAGE>
                                      -9-

increase or decrease in the fair market value of the Company's common stock
determined in accordance with paragraph 6.5. Such adjustments shall be referred
to as "Book Value Adjustments."

     9.7  In addition to any fees earned by a Director under Section 3 of this
plan or paid under paragraphs 4.1 or 9.1 the Company shall also make a payment
to a Director's Grantor Trust (a "Guaranteed Rate Payment"), to be credited to
the deferred account maintained thereunder, for any year in which the net income
credited to the deferred account maintained under such trust does not equal or
exceed the Director's Net Interest Accrual for that year. A Director's "Net
Interest Accrual" for a year is an amount equal to: (a) the Interest Accrual
credited to the Director's Deferred Fee Trust Account for that year; less (b)
the product of (i) the amount of such Interest Accrual, multiplied by (ii) the
aggregate of the federal, state and local individual income tax rates
(determined in accordance with paragraph 9.10). The Guaranteed Rate Payment
shall equal the difference between the Director's Net Interest Accrual and the
net income credited to the deferred account maintained under the Director's
Grantor Trust for the year, and shall be paid within 90 days of the end of that
year.

     9.8  The Company shall also make a payment to a Director's Grantor Trust
(a "Guaranteed Principal Payment"), to be credited to the stock account
maintained thereunder, to the extent that the balance in the stock account as
of the end of any calendar year is less than 75 percent of the balance of the
Director's Stock Trust Account (net of federal, state and local income taxes)
as of that same date. For the calendar year in which the last installment
distribution is made from the Director's Grantor Trust, the payment made
under this paragraph 9.8 shall equal the amount, if any, needed to increase
the fair market value of the stock account maintained under the Director's
Grantor Trust; such that if a distribution of the stock account were then
made to the Director, the Director would receive the same amount he or she
would have received (net of federal, state and local income taxes) if his or
her Stock Trust Account were to be distributed on that same date with the
deferred fees that had been allocated to that Account taxed at the federal,
state and local income tax rates in effect on the date the fees were credited
to the Account and the balance of the Account taxed at the federal, state and
local income tax rates in effect on the date of the distribution. Payments
required under this paragraph 9.8 shall be made within 90 days of the end of
the calendar year, except the last payment which shall be made not later than
the due date of the last installment distribution from the Director's Grantor
Trust.

     9.9  In addition to the fees provided under Section 3, each Director (or,
if the Director is deceased, the beneficiary designated under the Director's
Grantor Trust) shall be entitled to a Tax Gross Up payment for each year there
is a balance in his or her Deferred Fee Trust Account or Stock Trust Account.
The "Tax Gross Up" shall approximate: (a) the amount necessary to compensate the
Director (or beneficiary) for the net increase in his or her federal, state and
local income taxes as a result of the inclusion in the Director's (or
beneficiary's) taxable income of the income of his or her Grantor Trust and any
Guaranteed Rate and Guaranteed Principal Payments for that year; less (b) any
distribution to the Director (or beneficiary) of his or her Grantor Trust's net
earnings for that year; plus (c) an amount necessary to compensate the Director
(or beneficiary) for the net increase in the taxes described in (a) above as a
result of the inclusion in his or her taxable income of any payment made
pursuant to this paragraph 9.9.

<PAGE>
                                      -10-

     9.10 For purposes of this Section, a Director's federal income tax rate
shall be deemed to be the highest marginal rate of federal individual income tax
in effect in the calendar year in which a calculation under this Section is to
be made and state and local tax rates shall be deemed to be the highest marginal
rates of individual income tax in effect in the state and locality of the
Director's residence on the date such a calculation is made, net of any federal
tax benefits. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if a Director is not a
citizen or resident of the United States, his or her income tax rates shall be
deemed to be the highest marginal income tax rates actually imposed on the
Director's benefits under this Plan or earnings under his or her Grantor Trust.

     9.11 If a Director's deferred fees have been paid to a Grantor Trust(s)
pursuant to paragraph 9.2, then at any time (and from time to time) prior to the
Director's retirement the Director may elect to have those deferred fees paid to
him or her from the Grantor Trust(s) either:

     (i)  in the order in which they were earned (i.e., the fees for the
          earliest year of service as a Director will be the first fees
          distributed from the Grantor Trust(s), the fees for the next earliest
          year of service as a Director will be paid on the anniversary of the
          payment of the first installment, etc.), or

     (ii) in reverse chronological order from the order in which they were
          earned (i.e., the fees for the Director's last year of service as a
          Director will be the first fees distributed from the Grantor Trust(s),
          the fees for the penultimate year of service as a Director will be
          paid on the anniversary of the payment of the first installment,
          etc.).

If a Director fails to elect a manner of payment for his or her deferred fees,
then those deferred fees will be paid to the Director in the order in which they
were earned. The date on which payments commence and the other terms governing
distributions from the Grantor Trust(s) shall be determined in accordance with
the terms of the Grantor Trust(s). A Director's deferred fees shall continue to
be paid until all deferred fees to which the Director is entitled to receive
under the Plan shall have been paid in accordance with the terms of the Grantor
Trust(s).

Exhibit A

                       IRREVOCABLE GRANTOR TRUST AGREEMENT


     THIS AGREEMENT, made this ____ day of ______________, 198_, by and between
________________________ of ________, __________ (the "grantor"), and The
Northern Trust Company, located at Chicago, Illinois, as trustee (the
"trustee"),

                                WITNESSETH THAT:

     WHEREAS, the grantor desires to establish and maintain a trust to hold
certain benefits received by the grantor under the Abbott Laboratories
Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan, as it may be amended from time to time;

     NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS AGREED as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I
                                  INTRODUCTION

     I-1. NAME. This agreement and the trust hereby evidenced (the "trust") may
be referred to as the "_______________ 1988 Grantor Trust".

     I-2. THE TRUST FUND. The "trust fund" as at any date means all property
then held by the trustee under this agreement.

     I-3. STATUS OF THE TRUST. The trust shall be irrevocable. The trust is
intended to constitute a grantor trust under Sections 671-678 of the Internal
Revenue Code, as amended, and shall be construed accordingly.

     I-4. THE ADMINISTRATOR. Abbott Laboratories ("Abbott") shall act as the
"administrator" of the trust, and as such shall have certain powers, rights and
duties under this agreement as described below. Abbott will certify to the
trustee from time to time the person or persons authorized to act on behalf of
Abbott as the administrator. The trustee may rely on the latest certificate
received without further inquiry or verification.

     I-5. ACCEPTANCE. The trustee accepts the duties and obligations of the
"trustee" hereunder, agrees to accept funds delivered to it by the grantor or
the administrator, and agrees to hold such funds (and any proceeds from the
investment of such funds) in trust in accordance with this agreement.

                                   ARTICLE II
                         DISTRIBUTION OF THE TRUST FUND


     II-1. SEPARATE ACCOUNTS. The administrator shall maintain two separate
accounts under the trust, a "deferred account" and a "stock account." Funds
delivered to the trustee shall be allocated between the accounts by the trustee
as directed by the administrator. As of the end of each calendar year, the
administrator shall charge each account with all distributions made from such

<PAGE>
                                      -2-

account during that year; and credit each account with its share of income and
realized gains and charge each account with its share of expenses and realized
losses for the year. The trustee shall be required to make separate investments
of the trust fund for the accounts, and may not administer and invest all funds
delivered to it under the trust as one trust fund.

     II-2. DISTRIBUTIONS PRIOR TO THE GRANTOR'S DEATH. Principal and accumulated
income shall not be distributed from the trust prior to the grantor's
termination of service as a Director of Abbott (the grantor's "settlement
date"); provided that, each year the administrator may direct the trustee to
distribute to the grantor a portion of the income of the trust fund for that
year, with the balance of such income to be accumulated in the trust. The
administrator shall inform the trustee of the grantor's settlement date.
Thereafter, the trustee shall distribute the trust fund to the grantor, if then
living, in a series of annual installments, commencing on the first day of the
month next following the later of the grantor's settlement date or the date the
grantor attains age 65 years. The administrator shall inform the trustee of the
number of installment distributions and the amount of each installment
distribution under this paragraph II-2, and the trustee shall be fully protected
in relying on such information received from the administrator.

     II-3. DISTRIBUTIONS AFTER THE GRANTOR'S DEATH. The grantor, from time to
time may name any person or persons (who may be named contingently or
successively and who may be natural persons or fiduciaries) to whom the
principal of the trust fund and all accrued or undistributed income thereof
shall be distributed in a lump sum or, if the beneficiary is the grantor's
spouse, in installments, as directed by the grantor, upon the grantor's death.
If the grantor directs an installment method of distribution, any amounts
remaining at the death of the spouse beneficiary shall be distributed in a lump
sum. Each designation shall revoke all prior designations, shall be in writing
and shall be effective only when filed by the grantor with the administrator
during the grantor's lifetime. If the grantor fails to direct a method of
distribution, the distribution shall be made in a lump sum. If the grantor fails
to designate a beneficiary as provided above, then on the grantor's death, the
trustee shall distribute the balance of the trust fund in a lump sum to the
executor or administrator of the grantor's estate.

     II-4. FACILITY OF PAYMENT. When a person entitled to a distribution
hereunder is under legal disability, or, in the trustee's opinion, is in any way
incapacitated so as to be unable to manage his or her financial affairs, the
trustee may make such distribution to such person's legal representative, or to
a relative or friend of such person for such person's benefit. Any distribution
made in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be a full and complete
discharge of any liability for such distribution hereunder.

     II-5. PERPETUITIES. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this agreement,
on the day next preceding the end of 21 years after the death of the last to die
of the grantor and the grantor's descendants living on the date of this
instrument, the trustee shall immediately distribute any remaining balance in
the trust to the beneficiaries then entitled to distributions hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE III
                          MANAGEMENT OF THE TRUST FUND

          contract to sell, purchase, grant or exercise options to purchase, and
          otherwise deal with all assets of the trust fund, in such way, for
          such considerations, and on such terms and conditions as the trustee
          decides.

     (b)  To retain in cash such amounts as the trustee considers advisable; and
          to invest and reinvest the balance of the trust fund, without

          its agencies or which are backed by the full faith and credit of the
          United States Government or in any mutual fund, common trust fund or
          collective investment fund which invests solely in such obligations;
          and any such investment made or retained by the trustee in good faith
          shall be proper despite any resulting risk or lack of diversification
          or marketability.

     (c)  To deposit cash in any depositary (including the banking department of
          the bank acting as trustee) without liability for interest, and to
          invest cash in savings accounts or time certificates of deposit
          bearing a reasonable rate of interest in any such depositary.

     (d)  To invest, subject to the limitations of subparagraph (b) above, in

          security.

     (f)  To retain any funds or property subject to any dispute without
          liability for interest and to decline to make payment or delivery
          thereof until final adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction
          or until an appropriate release is obtained.

     (g)  To begin, maintain or defend any litigation necessary in connection
          with the administration of this trust, except that the trustee shall
          not be obliged or required to do so unless indemnified to the
          trustee's satisfaction.

     (h)  To compromise, contest, settle or abandon claims or demands.

     (i)  To give proxies to vote stocks and other voting securities, to join in

trustee during the reporting period; and showing the trust fund and the value
thereof at the end of such period.

     III-4. COMPENSATION AND EXPENSES. All reasonable costs, charges and
expenses incurred in the administration of this trust, including compensation to

                                   ARTICLE IV
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

     IV-1. INTERESTS NOT TRANSFERABLE. The interests of the grantor or other
persons entitled to distributions hereunder are not subject to their debts or
other obligations and may not be voluntarily or involuntarily sold, transferred,
alienated, assigned or encumbered.

     IV-2. DISAGREEMENT AS TO ACTS. If there is a disagreement between the
trustee and anyone as to any act or transaction reported in any accounting, the
trustee shall have the right to a settlement of its account by any proper court.

     IV-3. TRUSTEE'S OBLIGATIONS. No power, duty or responsibility is imposed on
the trustee except as set forth in this agreement. The trustee is not obliged to
determine whether funds delivered to or distributions from the trust are proper
under the trust, or whether any tax is due or payable as a result of any such
delivery or distribution. The trustee shall be protected in making any
distribution from the trust as directed pursuant to Article II without inquiring

liable for any distribution made in good faith without written notice or
knowledge that the distribution is not proper under the terms of this agreement.

trustee.

waived by the Person entitled to such notice.

     IV-7. SUCCESSORS. This agreement shall be binding on all persons entitled
to distributions hereunder and their respective heirs and legal representatives,
and on the trustee and its successors.

                                    ARTICLE V
                               CHANGES IN TRUSTEE

     V-1. RESIGNATION OR REMOVAL OF TRUSTEE. The trustee may resign at any time
by giving thirty days' advance written notice to the administrator and the
grantor. The administrator may remove a trustee by written notice to the trustee
and the grantor.

     V-2. APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE. The administrator shall fill any
vacancy in the office of trustee as soon as practicable by written notice to the
successor trustee; and shall give prompt written notice thereof to the grantor,
if then living, otherwise to each beneficiary then entitled to payments or
distributions under this agreement. A successor trustee shall be a bank (as
defined in Section 581 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended).

     V-3. DUTIES OF RESIGNING OR REMOVED TRUSTEE AND OF SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE. A
trustee that resigns or is removed shall furnish promptly to the administrator
and the successor trustee an account of its administration of the trust from the
date of its last account. Each successor trustee shall succeed to the title to
the trust fund vested in its predecessor without the signing or filing of any
instrument, but each predecessor trustee shall execute all documents and do all
acts necessary to vest such title of record in the successor trustee. Each
successor trustee shall have all the powers conferred by this agreement as if
originally named trustee. No successor trustee shall be personally liable for
any act or failure to act of a predecessor trustee. With the approval of the
administrator, a successor trustee may accept the account furnished and the
property delivered by a predecessor trustee without incurring any liability for
so doing, and such acceptance will be complete discharge to the predecessor
trustee.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                            AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

     VI-1. AMENDMENT. With the consent of the administrator, this trust may be
amended from time to time by the grantor, if then living, otherwise by a
majority of the beneficiaries then entitled to payments or distributions
hereunder, except as follows:

     (a)  The duties and liabilities of the trustee cannot be changed
          substantially without its consent.

     (b)  This trust may not be amended so as to make the trust revocable.

     VI-2. TERMINATION. This trust shall not terminate, and all rights, titles,
powers, duties, discretions and immunities imposed on or reserved to the
trustee, the administrator, the grantor and the beneficiaries shall continue in
effect, until all assets of the trust have been distributed by the trustee as
provided in Article II.

NOTE:
For the purpose of calculating this ratio, (i) earnings have been calculated by
adjusting net earnings for taxes on earnings; interest expense; capitalized
interest cost, net of amortization; minority interest; and the portion of
rentals representative of the interest factor, (ii) Abbott considers one-third
of rental expense to be the amount representing return on capital, and (iii)
fixed charges comprise total interest expense, including capitalized interest
and such portion of rentals.
