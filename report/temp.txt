\section{State Spaces}

RL algorithms aim to discover a policy $\pi: S \to A$ mapping from a state space to an action space that maximizes the agent's
reward. A state space represents situations the agent can encounter within a given environment.
Thus, proper representation of the state space is crucial in successful RL-based learning. 

\subsection{Volatility-Augmented State Spaces}

\cite{drl_mvo} provides a simple yet effective state space setup augmented with 
volatility indicators that characterize market trends. We provide a brief description here.

Let asset $i$'s price at time $t$ be denoted $P_{i, t}$. Then the one-period simple return of the asset 
is $R_{i, t} = \frac{P_{i, t} - P_{i, t-1}}{P_{i, t-1}}$ and the one-period gross return is $\frac{P_{i, t}}{P_{i, t-1}} = R_{i, t} + 1$. 
Thus, one-period log returns can be denoted $r_{i, t} = \log(R_{i, t} + 1)$. Given a universe of 
$n$ assets and cash denoted by $c$, the authors form the subsequent $[(n + 1) \times T]$ state matrix:
\begin{align*}
  S_t = \begin{bmatrix}
    w_1 & r_{1, t-1} & \cdots & r_{1, t - T + 1}\\
    w_2 & r_{2, t-1} & \cdots & r_{2, t - T + 1}\\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
    w_n & r_{n, t-1} & \hdots & r_{n, t - T + 1}\\
    w_c & vol_{20} & \frac{vol_{20}}{vol_{60}} & VIX_t \ldots
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
where the first column is the portfolio weights of each asset at the beginning of time $t$, which 
can differ slightly from the portfolio weights at the end of time $t-1$. The last row features three
market volatility indicators --- $vol_{20}, \frac{vol_{20}}{vol_{60}}$, and $VIX_t$ --- which are 
particularly important given the authors' imposed long-only and no-leverage constraints.
\begin{align*}
  w_c \geq 0, \ w_i \geq 0 \:|\: \forall \ i&&
  w_c + \sum_{i=1}^n w_i = 1
\end{align*}
The first indicator, $vol_{20}$, is the $20$-day rolling window standard deviation of daily S$\&$P500 returns. 
Similarly, $vol_{20}$ is the $60$-day rolling window standard deviation of daily S$\&$P500 returns. Thus, their ratio 
is given by $\frac{vol_{20}}{vol_{60}}$. If $\frac{vol_{20}}{vol_{60}} < 1$, then the
last $20$ days have been less volatile than the last $60$ days, which suggests a shift from a high volatility 
market trend to a lower volatility market trend. Finally, the last indicator $VIX$ is a measure 
of the stock market's expected volatility.
